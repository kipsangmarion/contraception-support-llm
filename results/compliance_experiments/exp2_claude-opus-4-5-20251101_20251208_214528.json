The copper IUD is >99% effective for pregnancy prevention and is a good long-term option. One important note: while the IUD prevents pregnancy, it doesn't protect against other STIs, so you should continue using condoms if you're at risk of transmitting HIV or contracting other infections. The IUD placement should be done by a trained provider, and it's good to ensure your HIV treatment is stable. This is considered a very safe and effective option for you.",

I want to give you accurate information based on WHO guidelines.\n\n## Short Answer\n\n**Yes, you can use a copper IUD.** According to WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria, the copper IUD is classified as **Category 2** for women living with HIV who are clinically well on antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\n---\n\n## What Category 2 Means\n\nCategory 2 means the **advantages generally outweigh the risks**. You can use this method, though it may require some additional follow-up with your healthcare provider.\n\n---\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n### Benefits of the Copper IUD:\n- Highly effective (over 99%)\n- Long-acting (up to 12 years)\n- Hormone-free — no interactions with your ART medications\n- Does not affect breastfeeding\n- Fertility returns immediately after removal\n\n### Things to Discuss with Your Provider:\n- Your current CD4 count and viral load\n- Whether you have any current pelvic infections\n- Your overall health status\n\n### Important Reminders:\n- The copper IUD **does not protect against HIV transmission** to partners\n- **Consistent condom use** is still recommended to prevent transmission and protect against other STIs\n- Dual protection (IUD + condoms) is an excellent strategy\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI'd encourage you to discuss this option with your healthcare provider, who can assess your individual situation and insert the IUD safely.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this or other contraceptive options?",

It takes courage to think about your health and future.\n\n## You have the right to access family planning information and services\n\nAs a teenager, you can absolutely consider and use contraception if you're sexually active or planning to be. In Rwanda, adolescents can access family planning services without needing parental consent.\n\n## Things to consider:\n\n**Your situation matters most.** There's no single \"right\" answer for all teenagers. What's best depends on:\n- Whether you're currently sexually active\n- Your health history\n- Your personal preferences and lifestyle\n- Your future plans\n\n**Many methods are safe for adolescents.** According to WHO guidelines, most contraceptive methods are safe for young people, including:\n- **Condoms** – also protect against STIs\n- **Pills, patches, rings** – hormonal options\n- **Injectables** – like DMPA (Depo-Provera)\n- **Implants** – highly effective, long-lasting\n- **IUDs** – safe for adolescents, including those who haven't had children\n\n## My recommendation:\n\nI'd encourage you to visit a health facility or youth-friendly service point where a trained provider can:\n- Discuss your specific needs privately\n- Explain all your options without judgment\n- Help you choose what fits your life\n\n**You don't have to decide alone.** Would you like more information about any specific method, or do you have other questions I can help with?",

In Rwanda, family planning is integrated into maternal health services, so health providers will talk to you about family planning soon - often before you leave the health center or during your postnatal visits. Some methods like the IUD or implant can even be provided immediately after delivery (postplacental insertion) if you're interested. During your postnatal care visits, providers will discuss your options based on whether you're breastfeeding and your preferences. You don't have to wait - you can start planning for spacing your children right away. Providers will help you choose a method that's safe while breastfeeding and fits your family goals.",
