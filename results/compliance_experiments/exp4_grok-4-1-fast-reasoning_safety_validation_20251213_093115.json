For adolescents (whose bones are still developing), this is something to discuss with a provider. The effect is usually reversible after stopping.\n\n**Return to Fertility:** It may take **6-12 months** (sometimes longer) after stopping before fertility returns.

I want to give you clear guidance based on WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria.\n\n## Direct Answer About the Patch\n\n**No, the combined hormonal patch is not recommended for you.**\n\nAccording to WHO MEC, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is classified as **Category 4** (unacceptable health risk) for combined hormonal contraceptives, which includes:\n- Combined patches (like Xulane/Evra)\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills\n- Combined vaginal ring\n\nThis applies even though your DVT was 5 years ago, because the estrogen in these methods increases clotting risk, and having had a DVT means you have an elevated baseline risk for another clot.\n\n## Safe and Effective Options for You\n\nThe good news is you have several highly effective methods that are **Category 1 or 2** (safe to use):\n\n| Method | WHO Category | Typical Use Effectiveness |\n|--------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| Copper IUD | Category 1 | >99% |\n| Hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena) | Category 2 | >99% |\n| Progestin-only implant | Category 2 | >99% |\n| Progestin-only pills | Category 2 | 91-93% |\n| DMPA injection | Category 2 | 94% |\n| Condoms | Category 1 | 85-87% |\n\n**Progestin-only methods** don't carry the same clotting risk as combined methods containing estrogen.\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nBefore starting any method, please:\n1. **Discuss with a healthcare provider** who can review your complete medical history\n2. **Mention** any family history of clotting disorders\n3. **Ask** whether you've been tested for inherited clotting conditions\n\n## Would You Like More Information?\n\nI'm happy to explain more about any of the safe options listed above.

It does **not** contain hormones.\n\n## Important Points\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Long-acting and reversible (fertility returns immediately after removal)\n- Hormone-free option\n- Can also be used as **emergency contraception** (within 5 days of unprotected sex)\n\n**Considerations:**\n- May cause heavier or longer periods, especially in the first few months\n- Some cramping after insertion is normal\n- Does **not** protect against STIs/HIV\n\n## In Rwanda\n\nCopper IUDs are available at health centers and hospitals. A trained provider must insert and remove it.\n\n---\n\nWould you like information about who can safely use the copper IUD, or how it compares to other methods?",

Starting before 6 weeks is Category 2 – usually acceptable but discuss with your provider\n- **Combined hormonal methods** (pills, patch, ring with estrogen): **Wait at least 6 months** if fully breastfeeding, as estrogen may reduce milk supply\n\n### Requires Waiting\n- **Combined hormonal contraceptives** (for non-breastfeeding): Wait **21 days** minimum due to blood clot risk postpartum\n- **IUD insertion** (if not placed within 48 hours): Wait until **4 weeks** postpartum\n- **Diaphragm/cervical cap**: Wait **6 weeks** for proper fitting\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n✅ **Fertility can return as early as 3 weeks postpartum** if not exclusively breastfeeding\n\n✅ **LAM (Lactational Amenorrhea Method)** can be 98% effective for 6 months IF:\n- Baby is under 6 months old\n- You're exclusively breastfeeding (day and night)\n- Your period hasn't returned\n\n## In Rwanda\nFamily planning services are available at health centers, and counselors can help you choose the best method for your situation.

It takes courage to seek information about your health, and I'm here to provide you with accurate, non-judgmental guidance.\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**Yes, teenagers can safely use most contraceptive methods.** According to WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria, age alone is generally not a barrier to contraception. Your ability to become pregnant means you have the right to access family planning information and services.\n\n## What to Consider\n\nThe decision to use contraception is personal and depends on several factors:\n\n**Are you currently sexually active or planning to be?**\n- If yes, contraception can help you prevent unintended pregnancy\n- If no, it's still valuable to have this information for the future\n\n**Your health matters**\n- Most methods are safe for teenagers (WHO MEC Category 1 or 2)\n- Some methods, like IUDs and implants, are actually excellent choices for young people because they're highly effective and you don't have to remember to take anything daily\n\n## Methods Often Recommended for Adolescents\n\n| Method | Typical Effectiveness | Notes |\n|--------|----------------------|-------|\n| **Implant** | >99% | Lasts 3-5 years, nothing to remember |\n| **IUD** | >99% | Lasts 5-12 years, safe for teens who haven't had children |\n| **Injectable** | 94% | Every 1-3 months |\n| **Pills** | 91% | Daily use required |\n| **Condoms** | 87% | Also protect against STIs |\n\n## Important for Rwanda\n\nUnder Rwanda's National Family Planning Policy, **adolescents can access family planning services without parental consent**. Services are available free or at low cost at public health facilities.\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nI encourage you to visit a health facility where a provider can:\n- Discuss your specific situation privately\n- Answer questions about any method you're curious about\n- Help you choose what fits your life and preferences\n\n**Would you like more information about any specific method, or do you have other questions I can help with?**",

This is a really common question, and I want to help you make an informed decision that works for you.\n\n## First, let's address the \"giving your body a break\" idea\n\n**According to WHO guidance, there is no medical need to take breaks from hormonal contraception.** This is actually a widespread myth. Research shows that:\n\n- Hormonal methods don't \"build up\" in your body\n- Fertility returns quickly after stopping most methods (often within days to weeks)\n- Long-term use of hormonal contraception is safe for healthy individuals\n- There's no benefit to periodic \"rest periods\"\n\n## What might be behind this feeling?\n\nSometimes when people want a \"break,\" there's an underlying concern. Can you tell me more about what's prompting this? For example:\n\n- Are you experiencing **side effects** you don't like?\n- Have you heard concerns about **long-term safety**?\n- Are you considering a **different method**?\n- Has your **life situation changed** (new relationship, health changes)?\n\n## If you don't want to get pregnant\n\n**This is the key point:** If you stop your current method without switching to another, you can become pregnant very quickly—sometimes within the first cycle.\n\n### Your options include:\n\n| If you want... | Consider... |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| Non-hormonal protection | Copper IUD, condoms, fertility awareness methods, diaphragm |\n| Lower-hormone option | Hormonal IUD (mostly local effect), progestin-only methods |\n| To address side effects | Switching to a different formulation or method |\n\n## My recommendation\n\nBefore stopping your current method, let's talk about:\n1. **What specifically** is making you want to stop?\n2. **What method** are you currently using?\n3. **What would work** for your lifestyle and preferences?\n\nI'm here to help you find a solution that addresses your concerns while keeping you protected.

This is why providers may screen for STIs beforehand.\n\n---\n\n### What WHO Guidelines Say\n\nThe IUD is classified as **WHO MEC Category 1 or 2** (safe) for most people, and is:\n- **Over 99% effective** (one of the most effective methods available)\n- Long-acting (copper IUD: up to 12 years; hormonal IUD: 3-8 years depending on type)\n- Reversible – fertility returns quickly after removal\n\n---\n\n### Warning Signs to Know\n\nIf you choose an IUD, seek care if you experience:\n- Severe abdominal pain\n- Fever or chills\n- Unusual discharge with odor\n- You can't feel the strings (or they feel longer/shorter)\n\n---\n\n### My Suggestion\n\nYour friend's experience is valid for her, but it may not predict yours.

When pills are missed, effectiveness drops from **99% (perfect use) to about 91% (typical use)** – meaning about 9 in 100 people get pregnant in a year with typical use.\n\n## Options to Consider\n\n### 1. **Strategies to Improve Pill-Taking**\n- Set a daily phone alarm\n- Link it to a daily habit (morning tea, brushing teeth)\n- Use a pill reminder app\n- Keep pills somewhere visible\n\n### 2. **Consider a \"Forgettable\" Method**\nIf remembering daily is challenging, you might explore methods that don't require daily action:\n\n| Method | How Often to Think About It | Effectiveness (Typical Use) |\n|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Injection (DMPA)** | Every 3 months | 94% |\n| **Implant** | Every 3-5 years | >99% |\n| **IUD (hormonal or copper)** | 5-12 years | >99% |\n| **Monthly Injectable** | Monthly | 94% |\n\nThese are called **Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs)** and are highly effective precisely because they don't depend on daily memory.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI'd encourage you to:\n1. **Reflect** on what matters most to you (convenience, hormones vs. non-hormonal, future pregnancy plans)\n2. **Visit a health facility** to discuss options – in Rwanda, family planning services are available at health centers\n\n**Would you like more information about any specific method?** I'm happy to explain how each one works, side effects, or what to expect.",

This is why:\n- STI screening may be offered before insertion\n- Using condoms alongside your IUD protects against STIs\n\n---\n\n**Do you have other questions about IUDs, or would you like information about any other contraceptive options?** I'm here to help you make the choice that's right for you.",

Some people believe it helps \"cleanse\" the body or restore natural cycles, but this is not supported by scientific evidence.\n\n---\n\n### What You Should Do Instead\n\nRather than taking breaks, it's more helpful to:\n\n1. **Have regular check-ins** with your healthcare provider (annually is usually sufficient)\n2. **Monitor for any changes** in your health that might affect eligibility\n3. **Reassess your needs** – your contraceptive preferences may change over time\n\n---\n\n### When to Reconsider the Pill\n\nYou should consult a provider if you develop:\n- Migraine with aura\n- High blood pressure\n- Start smoking (especially if over 35)\n- Other significant health changes\n\n---\n\nIs there anything else about your pill use you'd like to discuss?",

I want to give you accurate, evidence-based information to help you make an informed choice.\n\n---\n\n## Regarding Herbal Supplements\n\n**Important:** The WHO Family Planning Global Handbook does **not recommend** herbal supplements as reliable contraception. Here's why:\n\n- **No proven effectiveness** for preventing pregnancy\n- **Safety concerns** – many herbal products can interact with medications or have unknown side effects\n- **No standardization** – dosages and ingredients vary widely\n- **Some herbs may actually be harmful** during early pregnancy if conception occurs\n\n**My recommendation:** If you're interested in herbal supplements for other health reasons, please discuss with a healthcare provider, but don't rely on them for pregnancy prevention.\n\n---\n\n## WHO-Recognized Natural/Fertility Awareness-Based Methods\n\nIf you prefer non-hormonal, non-device methods, there **are** WHO-recognized options:\n\n| Method | Typical Use Effectiveness | Perfect Use Effectiveness |\n|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Standard Days Method (SDM)** | 88% | 95% |\n| **Lactational Amenorrhea (LAM)** | 98% (first 6 months) | 99.5% |\n| **Symptothermal Method** | 76-88% | 95-99% |\n| **TwoDay Method** | 86% | 96% |\n| **Withdrawal** | 78% | 96% |\n\n---\n\n## What These Methods Require\n\n**Fertility Awareness-Based Methods work best when you:**\n- Receive proper training from a qualified provider\n- Track your cycle consistently every day\n- Abstain from sex or use backup method during fertile days\n- Have regular menstrual cycles\n- Have a cooperative partner\n\n**They may NOT be ideal if:**\n- Your cycles are irregular\n- You recently gave birth, are breastfeeding, or approaching menopause\n- You cannot abstain during fertile periods\n- You need highly reliable protection\n\n---\n\n## In Rwanda\n\n- **Training is available** at health centers for fertility awareness methods\n- You can combine natural methods with other approaches\n- Providers can help you identify your",

The IUD sits inside your uterus, which is beyond the cervix and not reachable during intercourse.\n\n### What About the Strings?\n\nThe IUD has thin strings that extend through the cervix into the upper vagina. Here's what to know:\n\n**Initially (first few weeks):**\n- The strings may feel slightly firm or \"pokey\" to a partner\n- This is more common right after insertion when strings are newer\n\n**Over time:**\n- The strings typically soften and curl around the cervix\n- Most partners report they either don't feel them or only notice them occasionally\n\n### If Your Partner Does Feel the Strings\n\nThis is not harmful, but if it causes discomfort:\n\n- **Wait a few weeks** – strings often soften naturally\n- **Visit your provider** – they can trim the strings shorter\n- **Note:** Strings that are too short can sometimes be more noticeable, so discuss the right length with your provider\n\n### When to Seek Care\n\nContact your healthcare provider if:\n- You or your partner feel something hard or plastic (not just soft strings)\n- The strings seem much longer or shorter than before\n- You experience pain during intercourse\n\n---\n\n**Would you like more information about IUDs, or do you have other questions about family planning options?**",
