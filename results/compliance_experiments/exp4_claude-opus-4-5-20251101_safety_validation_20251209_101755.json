This is exactly the kind of health information that matters for contraceptive safety.\n\n## Important Safety Information\n\n**Migraines with aura are a significant concern for combined hormonal contraceptives** (pills containing both estrogen and progestin).\n\nAccording to WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria:\n\n| Method | MEC Category | What it means |\n|--------|--------------|---------------|\n| Combined pills (COCs) | **Category 4** | Should NOT be used |\n| Combined patch/ring | **Category 4** | Should NOT be used |\n\n### Why this matters:\nMigraines with aura indicate changes in blood flow to the brain. Combined hormonal contraceptives (which contain estrogen) increase the risk of **ischemic stroke** in people who have migraines with aura. This risk is considered unacceptable, which is why it's a Category 4.\n\n---\n\n## Safe Alternatives That Can Help With Cramps\n\nThe good news is you have several effective options that are **safe for you (MEC Category 1 or 2)**:\n\n**Progestin-only methods:**\n- **Hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena)** – Often *reduces* cramping and bleeding significantly\n- **Progestin-only pills** (\"mini-pills\")\n- **Injectable (Depo-Provera)**\n- **Implant (Jadelle/Implanon)**\n\n**Non-hormonal:**\n- **Copper IUD** – Very effective contraception, though may not help with cramps\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nPlease **share your migraine history clearly with your doctor** before any prescription is written. If they weren't aware you experience aura specifically (visual disturbances, numbness, speech changes before headaches), this changes the safety picture significantly.\n\nYou might say: *\"I want to confirm—I get migraines **with aura**. I understand combined pills may not be safe for me. Can we discuss progestin-only options?\"*\n\nWould you like more information about any of the safer alternatives?",

This is exactly the kind of detail that's crucial for safe contraceptive counseling.\n\n## Direct Answer About Combined Hormonal Pills\n\n**Based on WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria, combined hormonal contraceptives (the \"pill\" containing estrogen and progestin) are NOT recommended for you.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n| Your Risk Factor | WHO MEC Category |\n|------------------|------------------|\n| Smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day + Age 35+ | **Category 4** (Do not use) |\n\n**Category 4** means the health risks outweigh the benefits. The combination of:\n- Smoking heavily (a pack/day = ~20 cigarettes)\n- Being over 35 years old\n\n...significantly increases your risk of serious cardiovascular events, including blood clots, stroke, and heart attack when combined with estrogen-containing contraceptives.\n\n---\n\n## Safer, Highly Effective Options for You\n\nThe good news is you have excellent alternatives that are **safe regardless of smoking status**:\n\n### Progestin-Only Methods (No estrogen = safer for you)\n- **Implant** (Implanon/Jadelle) – 99.9% effective, lasts 3-5 years\n- **Hormonal IUD** (Mirena) – 99.8% effective, lasts 5 years\n- **Copper IUD** – 99.4% effective, hormone-free, lasts 10-12 years\n- **Injectable** (Depo-Provera) – convenient, every 3 months\n- **Progestin-only pills** (\"mini-pill\") – requires consistent daily timing\n\n### Non-Hormonal Options\n- **Copper IUD** – highly effective, no hormones\n- **Barrier methods** (condoms, diaphragm) – also protect against STIs\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nI'd encourage you to visit a healthcare provider to discuss these safer options. In Rwanda, family planning services are available at health centers, often free or low-cost.\n\nWould you like more information about any of these alternative methods? I'm happy to explain",

My advice depends on **which type of pill** you're taking and **how many pills you've missed**.\n\n---\n\n## If You're Taking **Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)**\n*(Contains both estrogen and progestin)*\n\n### For **1 missed pill** (up to 24-48 hours late):\n\n1. **Take the missed pill as soon as you remember** – even if it means taking two pills in one day\n2. **Continue taking the rest of your pack** at your usual time\n3. **No backup contraception needed**\n4. **Emergency contraception is NOT needed**\n\n### Important considerations if you've missed MORE than one pill:\n- The risk of pregnancy depends on *when* in your pack you missed pills\n- Missing pills in **week 1** (near your pill-free interval) carries higher pregnancy risk\n- You may need backup contraception (condoms) for 7 days or emergency contraception if you had unprotected sex\n\n---\n\n## If You're Taking **Progestin-Only Pills (POPs)**\n*(Mini-pill)*\n\nThese have a **shorter window** – if you're more than **3 hours late** (or 12 hours for desogestrel-containing POPs):\n\n1. Take the missed pill immediately\n2. Use **backup contraception (condoms) for 2 days**\n3. Consider **emergency contraception** if you had unprotected sex\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Help Me Give Better Guidance:\n\n- Do you know which type of pill you take?\n- Have you had unprotected sex since missing the pill?\n- How many pills have you missed?\n\n---\n\n## When to Seek Care\n\nContact a healthcare provider if:\n- You've missed 3 or more pills\n- You had unprotected sex and are concerned about pregnancy\n- You're unsure which type of pill you're using\n\n---\n\nWould you like more specific guidance based on your situation?",

This is something many people wonder about when planning for pregnancy.\n\n### The Short Answer\n\n**Most people can get pregnant very quickly after stopping the pill** – often within 1-3 months, though it can happen in the very first cycle.\n\n### What the Evidence Shows\n\nAccording to WHO guidance:\n\n- **Fertility returns immediately** – Ovulation can occur as soon as 2 weeks after stopping combined oral contraceptives\n- **No delay in long-term fertility** – The pill does not cause any lasting effect on your ability to conceive\n- **Average time to pregnancy** – Most people who want to become pregnant do so within 12 months of stopping, similar to those who weren't using contraception\n\n### What You Might Experience\n\n- Your first period may come within 4-6 weeks\n- Some people experience 1-2 irregular cycles before their pattern normalizes\n- This is your body's natural adjustment, not a sign of reduced fertility\n\n### Important Points\n\n✓ **Length of pill use doesn't matter** – Whether you used the pill for 1 year or 10 years, fertility returns the same way\n\n✓ **No \"waiting period\" needed** – It's medically safe to conceive immediately; some providers suggest waiting for one natural period simply to help date a pregnancy\n\n✓ **Age matters more than pill use** – Your fertility is influenced by your current age, not your contraceptive history\n\n### If You're Planning Pregnancy\n\nConsider starting folic acid supplements (at least 400mcg daily) before stopping the pill to support a healthy pregnancy.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about fertility or family planning?\n\n⚠️ **Note:** For personalized medical advice, please consult a qualified healthcare provider.",

You're Within the Safe Window\nAccording to guidelines, the ring can be out for **up to 3 hours** with no impact on effectiveness. At 4 hours, you're slightly past this, but still in a manageable situation.\n\n---\n\n## Since It's Been Slightly Over 3 Hours:\n\n**It depends on which week of your cycle you're in:**\n\n### Weeks 1-2 of ring use:\n- Reinsert immediately\n- Use **backup contraception** (condoms) for the next **7 days**\n- If you had unprotected sex in the last 5 days, consider **emergency contraception**\n\n### Week 3 of ring use:\nYou have two options:\n1. Insert a **new ring** immediately and start a new cycle (skip ring-free week)\n2. Remove the ring, have your ring-free week, then insert a new ring (only if ring was used continuously for 7+ days before falling out)\n\n---\n\n## Important Questions to Consider:\n- Did you have unprotected intercourse while the ring was out or in the past few days?\n- Which week of your ring cycle are you in?\n\n---\n\n## When to Seek Care:\n- If you're unsure which week you're in\n- If you've had unprotected sex and need emergency contraception\n- If this happens frequently (ring fit may need assessment)\n\nWould you like guidance on proper reinsertion technique, or do you have questions about emergency contraception?",

This is actually a very common concern, so let's explore it together.\n\n## First, Some Reassuring Information\n\n**The idea that your body needs a \"break\" from hormonal contraception is actually a myth.** According to WHO guidelines and medical evidence:\n\n- There is **no medical benefit** to stopping contraception periodically\n- Modern contraceptives do not \"build up\" in your body\n- Fertility returns quickly after stopping most methods (this varies by method)\n- Long-term use of hormonal methods is safe for healthy women\n\nYour body continues its natural processes while on contraception – it doesn't need time to \"reset.\"\n\n## Let's Explore What's Behind This Feeling\n\nSometimes when people want a \"break,\" there's an underlying concern. May I ask:\n\n- **Are you experiencing side effects** you don't like? (We can discuss switching methods)\n- **Have you heard concerns** from friends or family about long-term use?\n- **Is your current method** inconvenient or not fitting your lifestyle?\n- **Are your circumstances changing** (new relationship, health changes)?\n\n## If You Still Want to Stop Your Current Method\n\nSince you've clearly said you **don't want to get pregnant**, here are your options:\n\n| Option | Effectiveness (Typical Use) |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| Switch to a non-hormonal method (Copper IUD) | 99%+ |\n| Switch to a different hormonal method | Varies by method |\n| Use barrier methods (condoms) | 87% |\n| Fertility Awareness Methods | 88% (requires training) |\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nRather than stopping protection entirely, let's find a method that feels right for you. \n\n**What specifically concerns you about your current method?** This will help me suggest alternatives that address your needs while keeping you protected from unintended pregnancy.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and there may be a solution that gives you peace of mind without pregnancy risk.\n\n⚠️ **Note:** For personalized medical advice, please consult a qualified healthcare provider.",

Let me share what the evidence tells us.\n\n### About Pain During Insertion\n\n**What to expect:**\n- Most women feel **cramping during insertion** (similar to period cramps)\n- This typically lasts only a **few minutes**\n- Discomfort usually subsides within **1-2 days**\n\n**Pain management options your provider can offer:**\n- Pain medication before the procedure\n- Local anesthesia in some cases\n- Scheduling insertion during your period (when the cervix is naturally softer)\n\n*Everyone's experience is different - some women report minimal discomfort, while others find it more intense but brief.*\n\n### About Infection Risk\n\n**The evidence shows:**\n- IUDs do **NOT cause infections** when inserted properly in a clean clinical setting\n- There is a **small risk** (less than 1%) of infection in the **first 20 days** after insertion - this is related to the insertion process, not the IUD itself\n- After this initial period, infection risk is **no higher than for women without an IUD**\n\n**Important:** IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you're at risk for STIs, using condoms alongside the IUD is recommended.\n\n### What WHO Guidelines Say\n\nThe IUD is classified as a **safe, highly effective, long-acting method**:\n- **Effectiveness:** Over 99% (one of the most effective methods available)\n- **Duration:** Copper IUD lasts up to 12 years; hormonal IUD (if available) up to 5-8 years\n- **Reversible:** Fertility returns quickly after removal\n\n### My Suggestion\n\nYour friend's experience is valid, but **one person's experience doesn't predict yours**. I'd encourage you to:\n\n1. **Talk with a trained provider** who can assess your individual health and answer your specific questions\n2. **Ask about pain management** options available at your facility\n3. **Learn about all your options** - there are many effective methods, and the best one is the one that works for *you*\n\nWould you like information about what\n\n⚠️ **Note:** For personalized medical advice, please consult a qualified healthcare provider.",

Strategies to Remember Pills Better\n- Take it at the same time daily (link to a routine like brushing teeth)\n- Use phone alarms or reminder apps\n- Keep pills somewhere visible\n\n### 2. Switch to a \"Forgettable\" Method\nIf remembering daily isn't realistic for your lifestyle, consider methods that require less frequent action:\n\n| Method | How Often to Think About It | Effectiveness (Typical Use) |\n|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Injection (DMPA)** | Every 3 months | 94% |\n| **Implant** | Every 3-5 years | >99% |\n| **IUD (hormonal or copper)** | 5-12 years | >99% |\n| **Vaginal ring** | Monthly | 91% |\n| **Patch** | Weekly | 91% |\n\n## My Suggestion\n\nBased on what you've shared, **long-acting methods like the implant or IUD** might suit you well since they require no daily or monthly action once placed.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWould you like me to explain more about any of these options? I can share information about how they work, side effects, or what to expect during insertion.\n\nYou can also visit a health facility to discuss switching. In Rwanda, family planning services are available at health centers, often at low or no cost.\n\n**What matters most to you in a method?** (For example: no hormones, lighter periods, easy to stop, etc.)",

Taking breaks can actually:\n- Lead to unintended pregnancy\n- Cause your body to readjust each time you restart\n\n---\n\n### Your Choice Matters\n\nIf you're happy with the pill and have no concerning symptoms, you can continue confidently.

It's completely understandable to have concerns about this, and I want to help you understand what the research actually shows.\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**The relationship between birth control pills and cancer is nuanced** — pills are associated with a *slightly increased* risk of some cancers, but also a *decreased* risk of others. For most healthy women, the overall cancer risk is not a reason to avoid pills.\n\n---\n\n## What WHO Guidelines and Research Tell Us\n\n### Cancers Where Risk May Be Slightly Increased:\n\n| Cancer Type | What We Know |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| **Breast cancer** | Very small increased risk while taking pills and for ~10 years after stopping.

The WHO and medical guidelines do not recommend herbal remedies as contraception because:\n\n- Their effectiveness has not been proven in clinical studies\n- Dosages are not standardized\n- Some herbs can interact with medications or cause harm\n- Relying on them puts you at high risk of unintended pregnancy\n\n**If you're currently using herbs for contraception, I encourage you to consider adding or switching to a proven method.**\n\n---\n\n## Evidence-Based Natural/Non-Hormonal Methods\n\nIf you prefer to avoid hormonal or medical methods, there ARE effective natural options recognized by WHO:\n\n### Fertility Awareness-Based Methods (FABMs)\nThese involve tracking your fertile days and avoiding unprotected sex during that time:\n\n| Method | Typical Use Effectiveness | Perfect Use |\n|--------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Standard Days Method | 88% | 95% |\n| TwoDay Method | 86% | 96% |\n| Symptothermal Method | 78% | 95-99% |\n\n**Requirements:** Regular cycles, proper training, partner cooperation, and consistent tracking.\n\n### Other Non-Hormonal Options\n- **Condoms (male/female):** 85-87% typical use; also protect against STIs\n- **Copper IUD:** 99%+ effective, hormone-free, lasts up to 12 years\n- **Lactational Amenorrhea (LAM):** 98% effective if exclusively breastfeeding, baby under 6 months, and no period\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nI'd be happy to discuss:\n- What draws you to natural methods (concerns about hormones? Side effects? Personal beliefs?)\n- Which proven method might fit your lifestyle\n- Where you can get proper training for fertility awareness methods\n\n**What matters most to you in choosing a method?** This will help me give you more personalized information.",

I want to reassure you right away:\n\n**Being overweight does NOT prevent you from using birth control pills.**\n\n---\n\n### What WHO Guidelines Say\n\nAccording to WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria:\n\n| BMI Category | MEC Category | What This Means |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| BMI 30-34 (Obesity Class I) | **Category 2** | Generally can use; advantages outweigh risks |\n| BMI ≥35 (Obesity Class II+) | **Category 2** | Same - generally can use with some considerations |\n\n**Category 2 means:** The method can be used, and for most people, the benefits outweigh any small increased risks.\n\n---\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n**Effectiveness:** Combined hormonal pills remain highly effective regardless of weight. Some older research suggested slightly reduced effectiveness at very high weights, but current evidence shows pills work well across body sizes.\n\n**Health screening:** Your provider may want to check:\n- Blood pressure\n- Any history of blood clots\n- Other cardiovascular risk factors\n\nThis is because the combination of obesity + smoking + age over 35 + other factors can increase clot risk with estrogen-containing methods.\n\n---\n\n### If You Have Additional Risk Factors\n\nIf you have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, your provider might suggest:\n\n- **Progestin-only pills** (no estrogen)\n- **IUDs** (hormonal or copper)\n- **Implant**\n- **Injectable**\n\nThese are all **MEC Category 1** (no restrictions) regardless of weight.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nYour weight alone should not be a barrier to accessing birth control pills. You deserve full access to all contraceptive options.\n\nWould you like information about any specific method, or do you have other health factors you'd like me to address?",

      "model_response": "# IUD and Sexual Intercourse\n\nThank you for asking this common and important question. Many people have this concern before choosing an IUD.\n\n## Short Answer\n\n**In most cases, no** — your partner should not feel the IUD itself during sex. The IUD sits inside your uterus, which is beyond the cervix and not accessible during intercourse.\n\n## What About the Strings?\n\nIUDs have thin strings that extend through the cervix into the upper vagina. Here's what to know:\n\n**Initially (first few weeks):**\n- Strings may feel slightly firm or \"poky\" to a partner\n- This is temporary as strings soften over time\n\n**After settling (1-2 months):**\n- Strings soften and curl around the cervix\n- Most partners report they cannot feel them at all\n- Some may notice them occasionally but describe it as not bothersome\n\n## If Your Partner Does Feel the Strings\n\nThis is not harmful, but if it's uncomfortable, options include:\n\n1. **Wait** — strings often soften within 1-2 cycles\n2. **Have strings trimmed** — a provider can shorten them slightly (though very short strings can sometimes feel more poky)\n3. **Check string position** — ensure they're tucked around the cervix\n\n## When to Seek Care\n\nReturn to your provider if:\n- You or your partner feel something hard or plastic (not just strings)\n- Strings seem much longer or shorter than before\n- You experience pain during intercourse\n\n---\n\n**Would you like more information about IUDs or other contraceptive options?**",
