      "ground_truth": "It's important to know which type of birth control pill you're considering. Combined oral contraceptives (pills containing both estrogen and progestin) are not recommended in the first 6 weeks after giving birth while breastfeeding, as they may reduce your milk supply. However, progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills) are safe to use while breastfeeding and won't affect your milk. Other good options include the copper IUD, contraceptive implant, or barrier methods like condoms. I'd recommend discussing with your healthcare provider which option works best for you.",
      "model_response": "Yes, you can start certain types of birth control pills while breastfeeding your 3-week-old, but it depends on the type of pill. Here's a breakdown based on guidelines from the CDC, WHO, and ACOG:\n\n### Safe Option: Progestin-Only Pills (Mini-Pills)\n- **These are safe to start right away**, even at 3 weeks postpartum.\n- Examples: Norethindrone (e.g., Camila, Errin, Micronor).\n- **Why safe?** They don't contain estrogen, so they won't affect your milk supply or quality. Studies show no impact on breastfeeding success or infant growth.\n- Effectiveness: About 91-99% with perfect use; must be taken at the same time daily (±3 hours).\n- You can typically start them immediately without needing a backup method if you're not having sex yet, but use condoms or abstain for the first 7 days if you've already resumed intercourse.\n\n### Not Recommended Yet: Combined Estrogen-Progestin Pills\n- **Wait until at least 6 weeks postpartum** (ideally 4-6 weeks or when milk supply is fully established).\n- **Why wait?** Estrogen can reduce milk production (especially early on) and increase risks like blood clots postpartum.\n- If you prefer these for better cycle control or fewer side effects, discuss switching later.\n\n### Other Considerations\n- **Breastfeeding as contraception (LAM)**: Exclusive breastfeeding (no formula/pumps, baby under 6 months, no periods) offers ~98% protection in the first 6 months, but it's not foolproof—especially at 3 weeks. Combine with another method for reliability.\n- **Side effects of mini-pills**: Possible irregular bleeding, but often lighter periods.\n- **Other options if pills aren't ideal**:\n  | Method | Breastfeeding Safety | When to Start |\n  |--------|----------------------|---------------|\n  | Progestin IUD (e.g., Mirena) | Safe immediately | Anytime |\n  | Implant (Nexplanon) | Safe immediately | Anytime |\n  | Depo-Provera shot | Safe at 6 weeks | 6 weeks |\n  | Condoms/barrier methods | Always safe | Anytime |\n  | Natural family planning | Possible, but tricky with breastfeeding | After cycles return |\n\n**Important**: Always consult your doctor or midwife before starting. They can check your health history (e.g., postpartum bleeding, clots), confirm breastfeeding status, and prescribe the right option. If you're in the US, many postpartum visits cover this, or check resources like Planned Parenthood.\n\nIf you have more details (e.g., your health history or preferences), I can provide more tailored info!",

      "model_response": "No, combined oral contraceptives (the most common \"birth control pills\" containing both estrogen and progestin) are generally **not considered safe** for people with migraines with aura due to a significantly increased risk of stroke.\n\n### Key Reasons:\n- **Migraines with aura** (visual disturbances, sensory changes, etc., before the headache) are linked to a higher baseline risk of ischemic stroke, especially in women under 50.\n- **Estrogen in combined pills** further elevates this risk by promoting blood clotting. Studies and guidelines (like the CDC's U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use) classify this combination as **Category 4**—a condition that represents an **unacceptable health risk**. The WHO and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) agree.\n\n### Safer Alternatives for Cramps and Contraception:\nYour doctor might have meant a **progestin-only pill (POP, or \"mini-pill\")**, which doesn't contain estrogen and is usually safer (CDC Category 2—advantages generally outweigh risks). It can help with menstrual cramps for some people by regulating cycles.\n\nOther low-risk options for contraception **and** cramp relief:\n- **Progestin-only methods**: Implant (e.g., Nexplanon), hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena), or injection (Depo-Provera). These often reduce cramps by thinning the uterine lining.\n- **Non-hormonal**: Copper IUD, condoms, or diaphragm.\n- **For cramps specifically**: NSAIDs (like ibuprofen), prescription meds (e.g., tranexamic acid), or a levonorgestrel IUD.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Clarify with your doctor**: Ask exactly which pill they meant (combined vs. progestin-only) and discuss your aura history. They might recommend switching or monitoring.\n- **See a specialist**: A neurologist or gynecologist familiar with migraines can tailor advice, possibly including blood pressure checks or other stroke risk assessments.\n- **Track symptoms**: Note aura frequency and triggers to inform decisions.\n\nThis isn't medical advice—please follow up with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance. If your migraines are severe, effective contraception is important to avoid unplanned pregnancy risks too!",

Pregnancy during cancer treatment is generally not recommended due to risks to you and the fetus, and some treatments cause temporary infertility.\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Hormonal contraceptives** (pills, patches, rings with estrogen, or most progestin-only options) are typically **not recommended** for active breast cancer. Estrogen can fuel hormone-sensitive cancers, and even progestin-only methods carry risks per guidelines from the CDC, WHO, and ACOG (often categorized as \"unacceptable health risk\").\n- Your treatment may induce temporary menopause or amenorrhea, reducing natural fertility, but it's not reliable contraception.\n- Always consider STI protection (e.g., condoms) alongside pregnancy prevention.\n\n### Recommended Contraception Options\nFocus on **non-hormonal methods**, which are generally safe during cancer treatment:\n\n1. **Barrier Methods** (highly effective with consistent use; no hormones):\n   - **Male or female condoms**: 98% effective with perfect use; also protect against STIs.\n   - **Diaphragm or cervical cap** (with spermicide): 94% effective; requires fitting by a provider.\n   - **Spermicide alone** (foams, gels, films): Less effective (~72%), but can combine with barriers.\n\n2. **Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD, e.g., Paragard)**:\n   - Non-hormonal, long-acting (up to 10–12 years).\n   - 99%+ effective.\n   - Can be inserted if safe per your doctor (may cause heavier periods, but treatment might already affect bleeding).\n\n3. **Sterilization**:\n   - **Tubal ligation** (for you) or **vasectomy** (for partner): Permanent, 99%+ effective.\n   - Consider if you don't want future pregnancies.\n\n4. **Abstinence or Outercourse**:\n   - 100% effective if no penile-vaginal intercourse.\n\n5. **Fertility Awareness/Natural Methods** (e.g., tracking cycles, apps):\n   - Less reliable (~76–88% effective); not ideal during treatment due to irregular cycles from chemo/hormones.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Ask your doctor about **fertility preservation** (e.g., egg freezing) before treatment if relevant.\n- Progestin-only options (e.g., mini-pill, implant like Nexplanon, Depo-Provera shot, or levonorgestrel IUD like Mirena) *might* be considered in rare cases (e.g., non-hormone-sensitive cancer), but evidence shows potential risks—**do not start without specialist approval**.\n- Emergency contraception: Copper IUD is safest; ulipristal (ella) or levonorgestrel (Plan B) may be okay once but avoid if hormone-sensitive cancer.\n\nYour team can check interactions with meds like tamoxifen (which reduces fertility but isn't contraception).

This risk is significantly higher if you've had a prior stroke, regardless of time passed.\n- CDC MEC classifies combined hormonal contraceptives (pills, patch, ring) as **Category 4** (unacceptable health risk; do not use) for women with a history of cerebrovascular disease like stroke.\n- Factors like age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, or migraines with aura could make this even riskier.\n\n### Safer Alternatives\nConsider these options, which have lower or no increased stroke risk (consult a doctor to confirm suitability):\n- **Progestin-only pills** (mini-pills like norethindrone): Category 3 (risks usually outweigh benefits, but may be acceptable if no other options and monitored closely). No estrogen, so safer for clotting concerns.\n- **Hormonal IUDs** (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena): Local progestin delivery; Category 2 (advantages generally outweigh risks).\n- **Copper IUD** (Paragard): Non-hormonal; Category 1 (no restrictions).\n- **Implant** (Nexplanon): Progestin-only; Category 2.\n- **Depo-Provera shot**: Progestin-only; Category 3.\n- **Condoms, diaphragm, or fertility awareness**: Non-hormonal options with no stroke risk.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **See your doctor or a contraception specialist ASAP** for personalized advice. They can review your full medical history, stroke type (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic), current health, and run tests if needed.\n- Bring up your stroke details and any meds (e.g., blood thinners like aspirin or anticoagulants, which might interact).\n\nThis isn't personalized medical advice—guidelines can vary by individual.

This is usually not a major concern for short-term use (under 2 years), and bone density typically returns to normal after stopping.

Here's a balanced overview based on medical guidelines from sources like the CDC, WHO, and ACOG:\n\n### Effectiveness\n- **Very high**: 99%+ with perfect use (every 12 weeks), 94% typical use. Great for preventing pregnancy if you forget pills.\n\n### Pros for Teens\n- No estrogen, so safer if you smoke, have migraines, or certain health issues.\n- Often stops periods (helpful for heavy/painful ones).\n- Private—no daily routine, lasts 3 months.\n- Can access confidentially in many places (e.g., clinics like Planned Parenthood in the US often serve minors without parents).\n\n### Cons and Risks (Especially for Under 18)\n- **Bone health**: Can cause temporary bone density loss, which is a bigger concern during peak bone-building years (teens). FDA black box warning—avoid if you have low bone density or risk factors (e.g., eating disorders, heavy smoking). Effects reverse after stopping, but discuss screening.\n- **Side effects**: Irregular spotting/bleeding (first 6-12 months), weight gain (average 5-10 lbs/year for some), mood changes, headaches. Up to 50% stop within a year due to these.\n- **Fertility delay**: Can take 6-18 months to get pregnant after stopping (average 10 months).\n- **No STI protection**: Use condoms for that.\n- **Other**: Possible hair loss, acne worsening, or injection site soreness.\n\n### Is It Right for You?\n- **Depends on your health history**: Talk to a doctor or clinic ASAP—they'll check for contraindications (e.g., breast cancer risk, liver issues). Blood pressure and weight checks are standard.\n- **Alternatives to consider**:\n  | Method | Effectiveness (Typical) | Best For |\n  |--------|--------------------------|----------|\n  | IUD (e.g., Mirena) | 99% | Long-term (3-8 yrs), low maintenance |\n  | Implant (Nexplanon) | 99% | 3 yrs, arm insert |\n  | Pill/Patch/Ring | 91% | Daily/weekly, estrogen options |\n  | Condoms | 82-87% | STI protection + pregnancy |\n\n**Next steps**: See a healthcare provider (OB-GYN, school clinic, or Planned Parenthood) for personalized advice—it's free/confidential for most teens. They can give the first shot same-day if appropriate. Track symptoms and get the shot on time (up to 2 weeks late is usually okay with backup).\n\nQuestions? Ask away—stay safe!",

This means:\n  - No restrictions for initiation or continuation.\n  - Benefits outweigh any theoretical risks.\n- **No Hormonal Interactions**: The copper IUD is non-hormonal, so it doesn't interfere with ART medications or affect your HIV viral load/CD4 count.\n- **High Effectiveness**: It's over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy, making it a great long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) option.\n\n### Important Precautions:\n- **Viral Load and Health Status**: Ensure your HIV is well-controlled (undetectable viral load). If your viral load is high or you're not stable on ART, discuss risks with your provider.\n- **STI Screening**: Get screened and treated for STIs (like chlamydia or gonorrhea) before insertion, as IUDs slightly increase PID risk in the first few weeks post-insertion—but this risk is low in HIV+ women on ART.\n- **Insertion Considerations**: Your provider may monitor for infection closely. Some studies show a small increased risk of complications in untreated HIV, but ART mitigates this.\n- **Partner's HIV Status**: If your partner is HIV-negative, use condoms alongside the IUD for STI prevention (copper IUD doesn't protect against HIV/STIs).\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: Talk to your HIV specialist or gynecologist for personalized advice. They can review your ART regimen, viral load, and overall health.\n- **Resources**: Check WHO/CDC contraceptive guidelines or Planned Parenthood for more details.\n\nIf you have details about your ART meds or other health factors, I can provide more tailored info—but always verify with a healthcare pro!

With perfect use (used correctly every single time), they're 98% effective. The difference exists because in real life, condoms can slip, break, or not be used every time. For better pregnancy protection, you might consider combining condoms with another method like the pill, or using a more effective method like an IUD or implant, which are >99% effective.",
      "model_response": "### Effectiveness of Condoms in Preventing Pregnancy\n\nCondoms (both male and female) are one of the most accessible and effective barrier methods of contraception when used correctly. Here's a breakdown based on data from reliable sources like the CDC, WHO, and Planned Parenthood:\n\n#### Key Effectiveness Rates\n- **Perfect use**: 98% effective. This means **2 out of 100 women** will get pregnant in a year if used perfectly every time (e.g., putting it on correctly before any genital contact, using the right size/type, checking for damage, and using it for every act of intercourse).\n- **Typical use**: 82-87% effective. This means **13-18 out of 100 women** will get pregnant in a year. The gap comes from common real-world errors like:\n  - Late application (after genital contact starts).\n  - Breakage or slippage (about 1-2% of uses).\n  - Using oil-based lubricants (which degrade latex).\n  - Incorrect storage (e.g., exposure to heat) or expiration.\n\n| Use Type       | Effectiveness | Pregnancy Rate (per 100 women/year) |\n|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Perfect**   | 98%          | 2                                  |\n| **Typical**   | 87%          | 13                                 |\n\n#### Factors That Improve Effectiveness\n- **Use every time**: No exceptions, from start to finish of sex.\n- **Proper technique**:\n  1. Check expiration date and package for tears.\n  2. Use water- or silicone-based lube only (avoid oil-based like baby oil or lotion).\n  3. Pinch tip when unrolling to leave space for semen.\n  4. Withdraw while still erect, holding the base.\n- **Combine with other methods**: Pairing condoms with hormonal birth control (e.g., pills, IUD) boosts protection to nearly 100%.\n- **Quality matters**: FDA-approved condoms (look for the label) are rigorously tested.\n\n#### Additional Benefits\n- **STI protection**: Highly effective against HIV (85-95% reduction), chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Good but less perfect for skin-to-skin STIs like herpes or HPV.\n- **No hormones**: Safe for most people, including those who can't use hormonal methods.\n- **Over-the-counter**: Cheap, available without prescription.\n\n#### Limitations\n- Not foolproof—user error is the biggest issue.\n- Polyurethane or lambskin condoms are less effective against pregnancy/STIs than latex or polyisoprene.\n- If it breaks, use emergency contraception (e.g., Plan B within 72 hours) ASAP.\n\nFor personalized advice, consult a healthcare provider or visit sites like PlannedParenthood.org or CDC.gov/contraception.

This means if you take the pill exactly as directed—every day at the same time, without missing doses—only about 0.3 out of 100 women will get pregnant in a year.\n  \n- **Typical use**: **93% effective**. In real-world scenarios, about 7 out of 100 women will get pregnant in a year. This accounts for common issues like forgetting pills, taking them late, interactions with medications (e.g., antibiotics, vomiting/diarrhea), or starting a new pack late.\n\n#### Key Factors Affecting Effectiveness\n- **Consistency is crucial**: Set a daily alarm and use reminders. Some pills come in 21-day or 28-day packs.\n- **Interactions**: Certain meds (like rifampin or St. John's Wort) or conditions (e.g., severe vomiting) can reduce effectiveness—use backup contraception like condoms.\n- **Types of pills**: Progestin-only pills (mini-pills) have similar rates but require even stricter timing (within 3 hours daily), dropping to ~91% with typical use.\n- **Not 100%**: No method is foolproof except abstinence. It also **doesn't protect against STIs**—use condoms for that.\n\nFor the best results, track your cycle with an app, consider long-acting options like IUDs/implants (99%+ effective), and talk to a healthcare provider for personalized advice, prescriptions, or alternatives. Effectiveness can vary by individual health factors.",

Here's a breakdown of the main options, based on data from sources like the CDC, WHO, and clinical studies:\n\n### 1. **Levonorgestrel Pills (e.g., Plan B One-Step, Next Choice, or generic)**\n   - **How it works**: Over-the-counter hormone pill (1.5 mg single dose).\n   - **Time window**: Up to 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex; most effective in the first 24 hours.\n   - **Effectiveness**:\n     | Time since unprotected sex | Pregnancy risk reduction |\n     |---------------------------|--------------------------|\n     | Within 24 hours           | ~95% (prevents 19/20 expected pregnancies) |\n     | 24–48 hours               | ~85%                     |\n     | 48–72 hours               | ~58%                     |\n   - **Overall**: Reduces pregnancy risk by 75–89% if taken promptly.\n   - **Best for**: Most people; available without prescription (ages 17+ in US, varies by country).\n   - **Limitations**: Less effective in people with BMI >30 (obese); vomiting within 2 hours means retaking it.\n\n### 2. **Ulipristal Acetate (e.g., ella)**\n   - **How it works**: Prescription pill (30 mg single dose), stronger at delaying ovulation.\n   - **Time window**: Up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex.\n   - **Effectiveness**: ~85% overall (prevents 17/20 expected pregnancies), consistent across the 5-day window.\n   - **Best for**: Later timing or higher BMI (works better than levonorgestrel in obese individuals).\n   - **Note**: Prescription required in many places; interacts with some meds (e.g., certain antibiotics).\n\n### 3. **Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD)**\n   - **How it works**: Non-hormonal T-shaped device inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider.\n   - **Time window**: Up to 120 hours (5 days).\n   - **Effectiveness**: >99% (prevents nearly all expected pregnancies); can be left in as ongoing birth control (99%+ effective for 10+ years).\n   - **Best for**: Highest efficacy; great long-term option.\n   - **Limitations**: Requires clinic visit; not ideal if you have certain uterine issues or infections.\n\n### Key Factors Affecting Effectiveness\n- **Timing is critical**: The sooner, the better—every hour counts.\n- **Ovulation status**: Most effective before ovulation; less so if you've already ovulated.\n- **Body weight**: Levonorgestrel may be less reliable at BMI >25–30; ulipristal or copper IUD preferred.\n- **Multiple acts of sex**: Take EC after the *earliest* unprotected episode; use condoms for ongoing protection.\n- **Not for STDs**: Doesn't protect against STIs—get tested if needed.\n\n### Side Effects (Usually Mild, Last 1–2 Days)\n- Nausea, fatigue, headache, breast tenderness, irregular bleeding/spotting.\n- Next period may be early/late/heavier; take a pregnancy test if it's >1 week late.\n\n### Tips\n- **Availability**: Plan B generics are cheap (~$10–20 OTC); ella ~$50–60 (prescription). Copper IUD: $0–$1,300 (often covered by insurance/Title X clinics).\n- **No prescription needed for most pills** in the US/Canada/EU (check locally).\n- **Repeat use**: Safe occasionally, but not for routine contraception—use regular methods like pills, condoms, or IUDs for better protection.\n- **When to see a doctor**: If you have severe pain, heavy bleeding, or signs of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nFor personalized advice, consult a pharmacist, doctor, or clinic like Planned Parenthood.

Use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) if needed.\n- **Vomiting/diarrhea**: Rare, but severe GI issues might affect absorption.\n\n#### Comparison to Other Methods\n- More effective than condoms (87% typical) or withdrawal (78% typical).\n- Similar to the birth control pill (91% typical).\n- Less effective than long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) like IUDs (99%+ typical) or implants (99%+ typical).\n\n#### Tips for Maximum Effectiveness\n- Insert on days 1-5 of your cycle (or as prescribed).\n- Check its position daily (it can rotate but still works).\n- Store unused rings in the fridge.\n- It's prescription-only—talk to a doctor for fitting instructions and to rule out contraindications (e.g., smoking over 35, blood clots history).\n\nNuvaRing doesn't protect against STIs—use condoms for that. Side effects can include vaginal irritation, headaches, or nausea, but most fade over time. Effectiveness can vary by individual; consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice or alternatives like Annovera (reusable ring) or eluRyng (NuvaRing successor).

Effectiveness doesn't drop much over time if left in place.\n- Studies (e.g., from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project) show no significant difference in pregnancy prevention between the two.\n\n### Other Differences to Consider\n- **Hormonal IUD**: Releases progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the uterine lining. Often reduces menstrual bleeding/cramping (bonus for many users).\n- **Copper IUD**: Hormone-free; copper creates a sperm-hostile environment. May increase bleeding/cramping initially.\n- **Both**: Inserted by a healthcare provider, reversible (fertility returns quickly after removal), and safe for most people (including those who've never given birth).\n\nConsult a doctor to choose based on your health history, preferences, and any conditions (e.g., heavy periods might favor hormonal). Effectiveness assumes proper insertion and no expulsion (rare, ~2–10% risk in first year).",

It's highly effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly.\n\n#### Key Effectiveness Rates (per CDC and Planned Parenthood data):\n- **Perfect use**: More than **99% effective**. This means fewer than 1 out of 100 women will get pregnant in a year if injections are timed perfectly (every 12 weeks).\n- **Typical use**: **94% effective**.

Otherwise, use backup contraception (like condoms) for the first 7 days.\n\n#### Important Tips for Maximum Effectiveness\n- Get your next shot **exactly on time** (every 12-13 weeks). It's okay up to 2 weeks late, but use backup methods if delayed longer.\n- No need to worry about daily compliance like with pills.\n- It's reversible: Fertility usually returns within 6-12 months after stopping (average 10 months).\n\n#### Other Considerations\n- **Pros**: Long-lasting (3 months per shot), private, reduces heavy periods over time, safe for breastfeeding.\n- **Cons/Side Effects**: Irregular bleeding/spotting (especially first year), weight gain (average 5-10 lbs/year), mood changes, headaches, decreased bone density (reversible, but monitor with long-term use >2 years). Not protective against STIs—use condoms for that.\n- **Who shouldn't use it?** People with breast cancer history, uncontrolled high blood pressure, liver disease, or certain allergies. Discuss with a doctor.\n\nAlways consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice, as effectiveness can vary based on health factors. Sources: CDC, WHO, Planned Parenthood.

Common types include the Symptothermal Method (combines multiple signs), Standard Days Method (for cycles 26-32 days), and TwoDay Method (mucus-focused).\n\n#### Key Effectiveness Stats\nEffectiveness varies widely based on **perfect use** (following rules exactly every time) vs. **typical use** (real-world use with occasional mistakes). Data from reliable sources like the CDC, WHO, and studies in *Contraceptive Technology* (20th edition):\n\n| Method Type                  | Perfect Use (Pregnancies per 100 women/year) | Typical Use (Pregnancies per 100 women/year) |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **All FAMs (overall)**      | 0.4–5 (95–99.6% effective)                 | 12–24 (76–88% effective)                   |\n| **Symptothermal**           | 0.4 (99.6% effective)                      | ~2–10 (90–98% effective, with training)    |\n| **Standard Days**           | 5 (95% effective)                          | 12 (88% effective)                         |\n| **TwoDay**                  | 4 (96% effective)                          | 14 (86% effective)                         |\n| **Calendar/Rhythm only**    | 9 (91% effective)                          | 25+ (less reliable)                        |\n\n- **Perfect use** assumes flawless tracking, no sex during fertile days, and consistent daily charting.\n- **Typical use** accounts for human error (e.g., misreading signs, inconsistent tracking, having sex on \"safe\" days that turn fertile).\n\n#### Factors That Affect Effectiveness\n- **High success requires**: Apps/tools (e.g., Natural Cycles, which is FDA-cleared), daily charting, partner cooperation, and 3-6 months of practice to learn your cycle.\n- **Lower effectiveness if**:\n  - Irregular cycles (e.g., PCOS, stress, travel, illness).\n  - Perimenopause, postpartum, breastfeeding, or starting/stopping hormonal birth control.\n  - Alcohol, poor sleep, or illness affecting BBT/mucus.\n  - No backup method during fertile windows.\n- FAMs are **reversible, hormone-free, low-cost**, and have no side effects, but they don't protect against STIs.\n\n#### Comparison to Other Methods\n| Method              | Typical Use Effectiveness |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| FAMs                | 76–88%                   |\n| Condoms             | 87%                      |\n| Pill                | 93%                      |\n| IUD/Implant         | >99%                     |\n\n#### Tips for Success\n1. Use multiple signs (BBT + mucus) for better accuracy.\n2. Track for 3+ cycles before relying on it.\n3. Apps like Clue, Flo, or Natural Cycles can help, but verify claims (Natural Cycles has real-world typical use ~93% with their device).\n4. Combine with barriers for higher protection.\n\n**Important**: FAMs aren't ideal for everyone—talk to a healthcare provider or certified FAM instructor (e.g., via FACTS or Couple to Couple League) for personalized advice, especially if your cycles are irregular. If avoiding pregnancy is critical, consider more reliable options like IUDs. Always confirm with sources like CDC.gov or PlannedParenthood.org for latest data.",

It **must be used with spermicide** (a chemical that kills sperm) for maximum effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of its effectiveness, based on data from reliable sources like the CDC and Planned Parenthood:\n\n#### Key Effectiveness Rates (per 100 women using it for 1 year):\n- **Perfect use** (inserted correctly every time, with spermicide, and left in place for at least 6 hours after sex): **94% effective**  \n  - This means about **6 pregnancies** per 100 women.\n  \n- **Typical use** (real-world use, including occasional errors like incorrect insertion or forgetting spermicide): **88% effective**  \n  - This means about **12 pregnancies** per 100 women.\n\n#### Factors Affecting Effectiveness:\n- **Requires fitting**: A healthcare provider must size it for you (sizes range from 50-105 mm). It's not one-size-fits-all.\n- **Timing**: Insert up to 6 hours before sex; leave in for **at least 6 hours** (up to 24 hours max) after last intercourse. Add more spermicide for each new sex act.\n- **Common pitfalls**: Poor fit, no spermicide, or removal too soon reduces effectiveness.\n- **Not for everyone**: Less effective if you have vaginal anatomy issues, frequent UTIs (it can increase risk), or allergies to spermicide/latex (use silicone versions).\n\n#### Other Important Notes:\n- **STI protection**: None—use condoms for that.\n- **Availability**: Prescription needed for fitting; costs $0–$100+ initially, plus spermicide refills (~$10–20).\n- **Pros**: Reversible, no daily routine, some control over timing.\n- **Cons**: Messy, practice needed, not ideal during menstruation or postpartum.\n\nFor personalized advice, consult a doctor or clinic like Planned Parenthood. Effectiveness improves with proper training. If you have more questions (e.g., how to use it or alternatives), ask!",

      "ground_truth": "Tubal ligation (getting your tubes tied) is more than 99% effective and is considered permanent. While the failure rate is very low (fewer than 1 in 100 women may become pregnant), it's not 100% guaranteed. Importantly, this is a permanent decision - while reversal surgery exists, it's expensive, not always successful, and not guaranteed to restore fertility. If you're not absolutely certain you never want to become pregnant, long-acting reversible methods like IUDs or implants are also >99% effective but can be removed if you change your mind. Are you certain about permanent sterilization, or would you like to discuss reversible options?",
      "model_response": "**No, you cannot get pregnant in the vast majority of cases after tubal ligation (commonly called \"getting your tubes tied\"), but it's not 100% foolproof.**\n\n### How It Works\nTubal ligation is a surgical procedure that blocks, cuts, or seals the fallopian tubes to prevent eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus, where fertilization by sperm would normally occur. Without this pathway, pregnancy is prevented. It's considered a permanent form of birth control, typically done under general anesthesia via laparoscopy (small incisions in the abdomen).\n\n### Effectiveness\n- **Success rate**: Over 99% effective. According to the CDC and studies like the U.S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST study), the cumulative 10-year failure rate is about 1.85 per 100 women (or roughly 1 in 54).\n- Factors increasing risk: Procedures done right after childbirth, younger age at time of surgery, or certain methods (e.g., clips or rings have slightly higher failure rates than cutting and sealing).\n\n### Rare Risks of Pregnancy\nIf pregnancy does occur (extremely uncommon):\n- **Most are ectopic** (about 30-50% of post-ligation pregnancies), where the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. This is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.\n- Causes of failure: Tubes can partially reopen (recanalize), sperm can \"swim\" through tiny gaps, or the procedure might not fully block both tubes.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Not easily reversible**: Reversal surgery (tubal reanastomosis) is possible but expensive ($5,000–$10,000+), not always covered by insurance, and only successful in 40-80% of cases, depending on the original method and your health. IVF is often recommended instead.\n- **Doesn't protect against STIs**: Use condoms or other barriers for that.\n- **Regret**: About 20% of women who get it before age 30 report regret later, per studies.\n\n**Recommendation**: This is a big decision—talk to a gynecologist or reproductive health specialist for personalized advice, risks based on your health/history, and alternatives like IUDs, implants, or vasectomy (partner's option). They can also discuss newer methods like hysteroscopic sterilization (e.g., Essure, though less common now due to complications). Always confirm with imaging or tests post-surgery if concerned.",

Newer brands like Slynd (drospirenone) allow a 24-hour window, improving typical-use success.\n- **No protection against STIs**: Use condoms for STI prevention.\n- **Best for certain people**: Ideal if you can't use estrogen (e.g., breastfeeding, history of blood clots, migraines with aura).\n\n#### Tips to Maximize Effectiveness\n1. **Set reminders**: Use phone alarms or apps.\n2. **Start correctly**: Begin on day 1 of your period for immediate protection (or use backup for 48 hours if starting later).\n3. **Backup if needed**: Use condoms or abstain if you miss a pill, take it >3 hours late, or have vomiting/diarrhea within 3-4 hours of a dose.\n4. **Check your brand**: Effectiveness windows vary—confirm with your pharmacist or doctor.\n\nEffectiveness can be lower in people with higher BMI (>30) or certain health conditions.

      "model_response": "### When to Start Birth Control Pills\n\nThe best time to start birth control pills depends on the type of pill (combination estrogen-progestin or progestin-only \"mini-pill\"), where you are in your menstrual cycle, and your doctor's advice. **Always follow the specific instructions from your healthcare provider or the pill package, as they tailor it to your situation.** Here's a general guide based on CDC and ACOG guidelines:\n\n#### 1. **Combination Pills (most common, e.g., those with estrogen and progestin)**\n   - **Day 1 of your period** (first day of bleeding): Start immediately. You're protected from pregnancy right away—no backup needed.\n   - **Days 2–5 of your period**: You can start, but use a backup method (like condoms) for the **first 7 days**.\n   - **Any other day** (e.g., Sunday start or quick start): Use backup contraception for the **first 7 days**. This is common if you want protection ASAP without waiting for your period.\n   - **After childbirth or abortion**: Wait 3–4 weeks postpartum (or sooner if not breastfeeding) and use backup initially.\n\n#### 2. **Progestin-Only Pills (Mini-Pill)**\n   - Start **any day of the month**, but:\n     - If starting within the **first 5 days of your period**, protection is immediate.\n     - Otherwise, use backup for **48 hours**.\n   - These must be taken at the **exact same time daily** (within 3 hours) for effectiveness.\n\n#### Key Tips for Success\n- **Take one pill daily** at the same time, even during placebo weeks (if applicable). Use reminders!\n- **Backup contraception** (condoms, spermicide) is crucial in the first week if not starting on Day 1.\n- **If you've had unprotected sex recently**: Consider emergency contraception (e.g., Plan B) first, then start pills.\n- **Effectiveness**: 91–99% with perfect use; real-world ~91%. Doesn't protect against STIs—use condoms for that.\n- **Side effects/switching**: May cause spotting, nausea, or mood changes initially. If switching pills, overlap old and new for a few days.\n- **Special cases**:\n  | Situation | When to Start |\n  |-----------|---------------|\n  | Breastfeeding | Progestin-only after 6 weeks postpartum |\n  | No periods (e.g., PCOS) | Any day + backup for 7 days (combo) or 48 hours (mini-pill) |\n  | After IUD/implant removal | Immediately for seamless protection |\n\n**Consult a doctor or clinic** (e.g., Planned Parenthood) before starting—they'll prescribe the right pill, check for contraindications (smoking over 35, blood clots, etc.), and confirm timing. Apps like Clue or Flo can help track your cycle. If you miss pills, use our [missed pill guide](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/what-do-i-do-if-i-miss-a-birth-control-pill) or check the package.\n\nQuestions about your specific type or situation?

Backup for 7 days. |\n\n- **Had unprotected sex in the last 5 days?** Consider **emergency contraception** (like Plan B/levonorgestrel, available over-the-counter) ASAP—ideally within 72 hours, but up to 5 days. Ella (ulipristal) is another option up to 5 days.

Consider switching to a longer-acting method like the IUD, implant, or shot if daily pills are tough.\n\nYour protection isn't totally lost, but follow this to minimize risk.

Here's a breakdown based on standard medical guidelines from organizations like the CDC and ACOG:\n\n### **Ideal Times for Insertion**\n- **During your period (menstruation)**: This is often the preferred time because:\n  - The cervix is naturally softer and slightly open, making insertion easier and less painful.\n  - It confirms you're not pregnant (as pregnancy is unlikely during active bleeding).\n- **Anytime in your menstrual cycle**: Possible if a healthcare provider confirms you're not pregnant (via exam, ultrasound, or pregnancy test). Effectiveness starts:\n  - **Copper IUD**: Immediately, regardless of cycle day.\n  - **Hormonal IUD**: Immediately if inserted within the **first 7 days** of your cycle (day 1 = first day of full bleeding). If later, use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) for **7 days**.\n\n### **Special Circumstances**\n- **Postpartum**:\n  - Immediately after vaginal delivery (within 10 minutes of placental delivery).\n  - 4–6 weeks after birth (or sooner with provider approval).\n- **After cesarean (C-section)**: Typically 4–6 weeks postpartum.\n- **After abortion or miscarriage**: Immediately (highly effective emergency contraception if done within 5 days of unprotected sex).\n- **Breastfeeding**: Safe anytime after confirming no pregnancy; hormonal IUDs don't affect milk supply.\n- **Starting or switching birth control**:\n  - From pills, patch, or ring: Anytime if not pregnant.\n  - From Depo-Provera: Wait 12 weeks or confirm no pregnancy.\n  - As emergency contraception: Copper IUD within 5 days of unprotected sex.\n\n### **Important Considerations**\n- **Pregnancy check**: Always required before insertion unless you're in active menstruation or immediately postpartum/abortal.\n- **Preparation**: Your provider may recommend ibuprofen for cramping. Insertion takes 5–10 minutes in an office visit.\n- **Side effects**: Cramping, spotting, or irregular bleeding are common short-term; most resolve.\n- **Not recommended if**: You have certain infections (e.g., PID), uterine abnormalities, or uncontrolled bleeding.\n\n**Always consult a healthcare provider** (OB-GYN, clinic like Planned Parenthood) for personalized timing based on your health history. They can schedule it quickly—often same-day during your period. If you're in the US, resources like 1-800-230-PLAN can help find providers. Stay safe!",

Always consult your doctor or midwife for personalized advice, as they can assess your situation and help you choose the best option. Here's a general timeline based on guidelines from organizations like the CDC and WHO:\n\n### Immediate Postpartum (within hours to days after birth):\n- **Barrier methods** (condoms, diaphragms, spermicide): Can start right away—**immediately**. These don't have hormonal risks.\n- **Progestin-only methods** (safe for breastfeeding):\n  - Implant (e.g., Nexplanon): Can be inserted **immediately** (within 5 days).\n  - Progestin injection (e.g., Depo-Provera): **Immediately** (within 5 days).\n  - Progestin-only pills (mini-pill): **Immediately** (within 5 days), but must be taken consistently.\n- **Copper IUD**: Can be inserted **within 10 minutes** of placental delivery (highly effective immediate option).\n- **Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM)**: If exclusively breastfeeding on demand (no formula, pumping only if needed), no periods, and baby <6 months—**immediately**, but it's temporary (85-98% effective if criteria met strictly).\n\n### 3-6 Weeks Postpartum:\n- **Hormonal IUD** (e.g., Mirena): Typically at **4 weeks** (or during 6-week checkup).\n- **Combined hormonal methods** (birth control pills, patch, ring, or hormonal IUD if not immediate): Wait at least **3 weeks** (21 days), preferably **6 weeks**, due to higher risk of blood clots (venous thromboembolism) right after birth. Not recommended if breastfeeding in the first 6 weeks.\n\n### Anytime After 6 Weeks:\n- Most methods, including sterilization (tubal ligation or vasectomy for partner), can be done at or after your 6-week postpartum visit.\n\n### Key Notes:\n- **Fertility can return quickly**: Ovulation may happen as early as **3 weeks** postpartum (even before your first period), so don't rely on \"post-baby protection.\"\n- **Breastfeeding**: Delays ovulation for some (average 3-6 months if exclusive), but it's not foolproof. Progestin-only methods won't affect milk supply.\n- **Emergency contraception**: If needed (e.g., unprotected sex), use a copper IUD (up to 5 days post-sex) or pills like Plan B (within 72-120 hours).\n- **Spacing pregnancies**: WHO recommends waiting 24 months between births for health reasons.\n\nYour healthcare provider can insert long-acting reversible contraception (LARC like IUDs/implants) right in the delivery room if planned. Schedule a postpartum checkup (usually 1-6 weeks) to discuss options—many are free or covered by insurance.

Here's the step-by-step guidance based on standard medical recommendations from sources like the CDC and ACOG:\n\n### Key Steps for a Smooth Switch\n1. **Consult your healthcare provider first**: They’ll confirm you're not pregnant (via exam, ultrasound, or test), choose the right IUD type for you, and schedule insertion. This is usually done in-office and takes just a few minutes.\n\n2. **Timing of insertion**:\n   - **Continue your pills until the day of insertion**. Take your pill as usual that morning (or evening, depending on your schedule).\n   - **Ideal window for immediate protection** (no backup contraception needed):\n     | IUD Type          | Best Timing for Immediate Protection                  | If Inserted Later |\n     |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n     | **Hormonal (LNG-IUD)** | Anytime in cycle—effective immediately in most cases, especially if within first 7 days of your period. | Use backup (condoms) for 7 days. |\n     | **Copper (Paragard)** | Within 5 days of period start (ideally during menstruation). | Use backup for 7 days. |\n\n   - Many providers prefer inserting during or just after your period for easier placement and to minimize cramping/discomfort, but it's not required.\n\n3. **After insertion**:\n   - Stop the pill immediately.\n   - **Backup contraception**: Use condoms (or abstain) for 7 days if the timing doesn't qualify for immediate protection (see table above). You're protected from pregnancy right away otherwise.\n   - Expect some cramping, spotting, or irregular bleeding for a few days/weeks (more common with copper IUDs).\n\n### Why This Timing Works\n- The pill keeps you protected up to insertion.\n- IUDs are >99% effective long-term (3–12 years depending on type) and don't rely on daily compliance.\n\n### Things to Know\n- **No gap in protection** if you follow this.\n- Side effects vary: Hormonal IUDs often lighten periods; copper can make them heavier.\n- Cost: Often covered by insurance; check GoodRx or clinics like Planned Parenthood for low-cost options.\n\n**This is general info—not personalized medical advice.** Your provider may adjust based on your health history (e.g., heavy periods, anemia). Schedule soon if you're ready! If you have more details (IUD type, cycle info), I can refine this.",

If it's more than a week late, take a pregnancy test.\n- **Next steps**: \n  - See a doctor, clinic (e.g., Planned Parenthood), or pharmacist today for free/low-cost options and a prescription if needed.\n  - If you had unprotected sex again since taking EC, consider another dose or testing.\n- **Effectiveness note**: EC is about 75-89% effective (depending on timing/BMI), so regular birth control is key for ongoing protection (99%+ effective when used perfectly).\n\nIf you share more details (e.g., which EC brand, what regular method you're considering, or when you ovulate/had sex), I can give more tailored advice.

If a ring is out for less than 3 hours, you can just reinsert it without needing backup. Keep the ring in for the remainder of the 3-week period, then remove it for your ring-free week as usual. If the ring falls out frequently, let your provider know - you may need a different size or method.",
      "model_response": "### What to Do If Your Vaginal Ring Fell Out (4 Hours Ago)\n\nDon't panic—4 hours is still manageable, but you need to act quickly since most rings (like NuvaRing) recommend reinsertion or replacement if out for **more than 3 hours**. Here's step-by-step guidance based on standard medical recommendations (e.g., from NuvaRing or Annovera instructions). **Always check your specific ring's leaflet or consult a healthcare provider/pharmacist for personalized advice**, as rules can vary slightly by brand.\n\n#### 1. **Assess the Situation**\n   - **Find the ring**: If you have it, rinse it gently with **cool or lukewarm water only** (no soap, hot water, or chemicals—these can damage it or affect hormone release).\n   - **Timing matters**: What week of your cycle is it in?\n     | Week of Use | Action if Out >3 Hours |\n     |-------------|------------------------|\n     | **Week 1 (Days 1-7)** | Insert a **new ring** right away. Use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) for **7 days**. |\n     | **Week 2 (Days 8-14)** | Reinsert the same ring if intact. Use backup for **7 days** (if it was in place ≥7 days before falling out). |\n     | **Week 3 (Days 15-21)** | Remove it (as scheduled) and insert a **new ring** at the usual time. No backup needed if on schedule. |\n   - If it's your first cycle or you're unsure, treat it like Week 1 (safest approach).\n\n#### 2. **Immediate Steps**\n   - **Reinsert if possible**: If it's Week 2 and clean/intact, fold and insert it now (like putting in a tampon).\n   - **Get a replacement if needed**: Go to a pharmacy for a new ring ASAP—many are available over-the-counter or by prescription.\n   - **Use backup contraception NOW**: Condoms, withdrawal, or abstinence until you've used backup for the required days (usually 7). Avoid relying on the ring alone.\n   - **Emergency contraception?** Consider it (e.g., Plan B/ella) if you've had unprotected sex since it fell out **and** you're in Week 1 or at high pregnancy risk. Take it within 72-120 hours (sooner = better). A provider can advise.\n\n#### 3. **Prevent Future Slip-Outs**\n   - Rings can fall out during sex, bowel movements, tampon use, or strenuous activity.\n   - Insert higher in the vagina (behind pubic bone).\n   - Check daily by gently feeling for it.\n\n#### 4. **When to See a Doctor**\n   - **Today/urgently**: If in Week 1, recent unprotected sex, or any symptoms (pain, unusual discharge, bleeding).\n   - Call your provider, go to a clinic, or use telehealth. They can check hormone levels or pregnancy risk.\n   - Track your cycle in an app for better management.\n\nPregnancy risk is low if you act fast, but backup methods are key. If you share more details (brand, week, recent sex?), I can refine this! Stay safe.",

      "model_response": "I'm happy to help you explore birth control options! At 25, you have a wide range of effective methods available, and the best one depends on factors like your health history, lifestyle, how often you have sex, desire for hormone-free options, STI risk, and future family plans. **Always consult a healthcare provider** (like a gynecologist, Planned Parenthood, or your primary doctor) for personalized advice, screening, and prescriptions—they can also help with costs via insurance or programs like Title X clinics.\n\nHere's a breakdown of popular methods, grouped by type, with **typical-use effectiveness** (real-world rates, including user error) from CDC data. Perfect use is often higher.\n\n### **Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) – Top Choice for Many (99%+ effective)**\nThese are \"set it and forget it\" options, lasting years.\n- **Hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena)**: Small T-shaped device inserted into uterus. Lasts 3–8 years. Lightens periods or stops them. Pros: Highly effective, low maintenance. Cons: Insertion discomfort, possible irregular bleeding initially. Hormone-free? No.\n- **Copper IUD (Paragard)**: Hormone-free, lasts up to 12 years. Pros: Emergency backup (up to 5 days after sex). Cons: Heavier periods/cramps.\n- **Implant (Nexplanon)**: Matchstick-sized rod in arm. Lasts 3 years. Pros: Very effective, private. Cons: Irregular bleeding, minor insertion procedure.\n\n### **Hormonal Methods (91–99% effective)**\nDaily/weekly/monthly commitment.\n- **Birth Control Pills**: Daily hormone pill. Pros: Regulates periods, reduces cramps/acne. Cons: Must remember daily; no STI protection. Types: Combined (estrogen + progestin) or progestin-only (safer for some).\n- **Patch (Xulane)**: Weekly skin patch. Similar to pills.\n- **Vaginal Ring (NuvaRing, Annovera)**: Flexible ring inserted monthly (or reusable yearly).\n- **Shot (Depo-Provera)**: Every 3 months at clinic. Pros: No daily action. Cons: Possible weight gain, bone density concerns with long-term use.\n- **Morning-After Pill**: Emergency option (Plan B up to 3 days post-sex; ella up to 5 days). 75–89% effective; not for routine use.\n\n### **Barrier & Short-Term Methods (71–88% effective)**\nNo hormones; good for STI protection (use condoms!).\n- **Male/Female Condoms**: 82–87% effective. Pros: STI protection, no prescription. Cons: Can break/slip.\n- **Diaphragm or Cervical Cap**: With spermicide, inserted before sex. 83–88% effective. Needs fitting.\n- **Spermicide, Sponge**: Over-the-counter, 68–86% effective alone.\n\n### **Natural/Behavioral Methods (76–88% effective)**\nNo devices/hormones.\n- **Fertility Awareness (tracking apps, temp, cervical mucus)**: Avoid sex on fertile days. Pros: Free, hormone-free. Cons: Requires diligence; apps like Natural Cycles can help but aren't foolproof.\n- **Withdrawal (pull-out)**: 78% effective. Risky due to pre-ejaculate.\n\n### **Permanent Options (99% effective)**\n- **Tubal Ligation (women) or Vasectomy (partners)**: Surgery for no more kids. Reversible? Sometimes, but not guaranteed.\n\n| Method | Hormone-Free? | STI Protection? | Cost (per year, approx.) |\n|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| IUD/Implant | Some yes | No | $0–1,300 (often free w/ins) |\n| Pill/Patch | No | No | $0–300 |\n| Condoms | Yes | Yes | $50–200 |\n| Fertility Tracking | Yes | No | Free–$100 (apps) |\n\n**Quick Tips:**\n- **Most effective overall**: LARCs like IUDs/implants (ideal if you want low effort).\n- **STI prevention**: Pair any method with condoms.\n- **Side effects**: Hormonal methods can cause spotting, mood changes, or rare risks (e.g., blood clots—screen for history).\n- **Access**: Free/low-cost via clinics; apps like Nurx/Clinic5 for telehealth delivery.\n- **Switching**: Easy to try/test methods.\n\nWhat are your priorities? E.g., hormone-free? Long-term? Frequent sex? Any health issues (migraines, smoking, PCOS)? Partner input? Let me know for tailored recs! 😊",

If you are active, **yes, use protection every time**. No method is 100% foolproof alone, so combine methods (e.g., pill + condoms) for \"double protection.\"\n- **Age isn't a barrier**: Teens can access birth control legally without parental consent in many places (check your local laws or clinics like Planned Parenthood).

They might test for STIs or suggest bloodwork. If you've been on hormonal BC long-term, your natural cycle might take 1-3 months to regulate.\n   - Schedule an appointment with a gynecologist, clinic like Planned Parenthood, or your primary care doctor ASAP.\n\n### 2. **Switch to Non-Hormonal or Barrier Methods**\n   These don't affect your hormones and can be used immediately:\n   - **Condoms (male or internal/female)**: 87% effective typical use. Easy to get (no prescription), protects against STIs, and great for casual or new partners. Use with lube to prevent breakage.\n   - **Copper IUD (Paragard)**: Over 99% effective, lasts up to 10-12 years, inserted by a doctor. Hormone-free, works right away, and you can have it removed anytime to resume fertility.\n   - **Diaphragm or cervical cap**: 88% effective with spermicide (83% without). Fitted by a doctor, reusable, inserted before sex.\n   - **Contraceptive sponge or spermicide**: 76-88% effective. Over-the-counter, but less reliable alone—best combined with condoms.\n\n### 3. **Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM) or Natural Family Planning**\n   - Track your fertile window using apps (e.g., Natural Cycles, Clue), basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or ovulation tests. Avoid unprotected sex during fertile days (about 8-10 days per cycle).\n   - **Effectiveness**: 76-88% typical use (up to 99% with perfect tracking). Requires daily effort, consistent cycles, and no breastfeeding/recent hormonal BC disruption. Apps like Natural Cycles are FDA-cleared as contraception when used correctly.\n   - **Pro tip**: Combine with condoms for \"double protection\" (boosts effectiveness to 99%+).\n\n### 4. **Other Temporary Options**\n   - **Withdrawal (pull-out method)**: Only 78% effective—**not recommended** as primary due to pre-ejaculate risks.\n   - **Abstinence or outercourse**: 100% effective if no penile-vaginal contact.\n   - **Emergency contraception**: Plan B (within 72 hours) or Ella (up to 5 days) as backup if something fails—available over-the-counter.\n\n### Quick Tips for Success\n- **Track everything**: Use an app to log your cycle from day 1 off BC.\n- **Partner involvement**: Discuss with your partner(s) for shared responsibility.\n- **STI protection**: Condoms are key if not monogamous.\n- **Signs of ovulation**: Watch for changes in mucus, temperature, or mittelschmerz (ovulation pain).\n- **What to avoid**: Don't rely on \"rhythm method\" alone (outdated and inaccurate).\n\nIf pregnancy would be unwelcome, the copper IUD or condoms + FAM are your safest bets for a true \"break.\" Everyone's body is different, so professional guidance is key—reach out to a provider today.

      "ground_truth": "I'm glad you're asking about this. IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication. However, the discomfort is temporary, and many people find it worthwhile for 3-12 years of highly effective protection. As for infections, modern IUDs have a very low infection risk. There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low. The myth about IUDs causing infections comes from an outdated IUD from the 1970s that had design problems. Today's IUDs are very safe. Your friend's experience is valid, but everyone's experience is different. Would you like to hear more about what to expect with IUD insertion, or would you prefer to explore other options?",
      "model_response": "No, you shouldn't avoid the IUD based solely on your friend's experience—myths and individual differences can make stories like that misleading. IUDs (intrauterine devices) are one of the most effective forms of birth control (over 99% effective), safe for most people, and used by millions worldwide. Let me break down the concerns with evidence-based info:\n\n### On Pain During Insertion\n- **It's often uncomfortable but usually brief**: Insertion feels like intense menstrual cramps for most people and takes just a few minutes. Pain levels vary widely—some feel almost nothing, others describe it as very painful. Factors like anxiety, cervical position, or having given birth vaginally can influence it.\n- **Ways to manage it**: Many providers offer:\n  - Ibuprofen (e.g., 600-800mg) 1 hour before.\n  - Local numbing (cervical block).\n  - Misoprostol to soften the cervix (though evidence is mixed on its effectiveness).\n- **After insertion**: Cramping or spotting for a few days is common but fades. Long-term, IUDs don't cause chronic pain for the vast majority.\n\nStudies (e.g., from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) show most people are satisfied post-insertion and would choose it again.\n\n### On Infections\n- **Low risk overall**: IUDs do **not** cause infections in healthy people. The main concern is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but:\n  - Risk is highest in the first 20 days after insertion (about 1-2% if you have an undiagnosed STI like chlamydia or gonorrhea at the time).\n  - After that, the risk drops to near zero—even lower than with no birth control.\n- **Screening prevents issues**: Providers routinely test for STIs before insertion.\n- Copper IUDs (non-hormonal) have a slightly higher initial infection risk than hormonal ones, but both are safe long-term.\n- No increased risk of routine infections like UTIs or yeast infections.\n\nData from the CDC and WHO confirms IUDs are safe and don't lead to infertility or ongoing infections.\n\n### Should You Get One?\n- **Pros**: \"Set it and forget it\" for 3-12 years (depending on type). Reduces menstrual bleeding/cramping (hormonal) or is hormone-free (copper). Reversible—fertility returns quickly after removal.\n- **Who might avoid it**: People with certain uterine abnormalities, uncontrolled PID, or heavy bleeding issues (for copper). It's great for most, including teens and those who haven't given birth.\n- **Bottom line**: Talk to a healthcare provider (OB-GYN, clinic like Planned Parenthood). They'll assess your health history, discuss options (hormonal vs. copper), and tailor advice. Your experience might be totally different from your friend's!\n\nIf you share more details (like your age, health history, or preferences), I can give more targeted info. Stay safe!",

      "ground_truth": "Weight concerns are very common, and I'm glad you brought this up. Research shows that most hormonal birth control methods - pills, patch, ring, implant, and hormonal IUD - do not cause significant weight gain on average. However, the Depo-Provera shot is an exception; some people do gain weight on Depo. Everyone's body is different, so individual experiences vary. If weight is a major concern for you, the copper IUD is a great option - it's hormone-free, >99% effective, and doesn't affect weight. Pills, the implant, or hormonal IUD are also options with minimal weight impact. Would you like to hear more about these methods?",
      "model_response": "It's a super common concern—many people worry about weight gain with birth control, and it's valid to think about how it might affect you. The good news is that the link isn't as straightforward as it seems, and it varies a lot by method, person, and lifestyle. Here's a clear breakdown based on reliable medical evidence (like from the CDC, ACOG, and recent reviews in journals like *Contraception*):\n\n### Does Birth Control Cause Weight Gain?\n- **Short answer**: Not all methods do, and for most, any gain is small (1-5 lbs) and often temporary, especially in the first 3-6 months as your body adjusts. Weight changes are more tied to factors like age, diet, exercise, stress, and genetics than the birth control itself.\n- **Myth busted**: Older studies fueled the fear, but large modern reviews (e.g., 2020 Cochrane analysis) show **no significant weight gain** for most hormonal methods compared to placebo.\n\n### By Method:\n| Method | Weight Gain Risk | Details |\n|--------|------------------|---------|\n| **Combined Pill (estrogen + progestin)** | Low | Minimal average gain (under 2 lbs/year). Some notice bloating/water retention early on. Low-dose pills may help. |\n| **Progestin-Only Pill (mini-pill)** | Low to moderate | Similar to combined pill; studies show little difference. |\n| **Patch or Ring** | Low | Like the combined pill—small, if any, effect. |\n| **Hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena)** | Low | No systemic weight gain in most studies; local hormone release. |\n| **Implant (Nexplanon)** | Low to moderate | Some gain 2-5 lbs, but not universal. |\n| **Depo-Provera Shot** | Moderate to high | Strongest link—average 5-10 lbs in year 1, up to 15+ lbs long-term. Not for everyone. |\n| **Copper IUD (Paragard)** | None | Non-hormonal, so no effect. |\n| **Condoms, Diaphragm, Sponge, etc.** | None | Barrier methods = zero hormonal impact. |\n\n### What You Can Do:\n1. **Talk to a provider**: They can review your history (e.g., BMI, metabolism) and suggest low-risk options like a low-dose pill, hormonal IUD, or non-hormonal methods. Apps like Nurx or Planned Parenthood can help start the convo.\n2. **Track and tweak**: If you start something and notice changes, switch early—most effects reverse quickly after stopping.\n3. **Lifestyle hacks**: Eat balanced (focus on protein/fiber), stay active (even 30 min/day walking), and monitor with an app like MyFitnessPal. This often offsets any minor shifts.\n4. **Alternatives if weight is a big worry**:\n   - Non-hormonal: Copper IUD, condoms + spermicide.\n   - Long-acting reversible: Hormonal IUD or implant (set-it-and-forget-it, high satisfaction).\n\nEveryone's body is different—some lose weight on the pill due to stabilized cycles! If you share more (like your age, preferred method, or health details), I can give more tailored info. Definitely chat with a doc before starting anything. You've got this! 😊",

Use backup 7 days | Yes if unprotected sex |\n   | **Mini-pill** (>3h late) | 48 hours | Yes |\n\n   - **Emergency contraception (EC)**: Plan B (levonorgestrel) works up to 72 hours after unprotected sex (best <24h); ella (ulipristal) up to 120 hours and more effective if >65kg. Get it OTC at pharmacies—no prescription needed.\n   - No backup? Avoid sex or use condoms until you've taken pills daily for 7 days straight.\n\n3. **Track better**: Use apps like Clue, Flo, or pill reminder alarms. Some packs have \"stickers\" or days marked.\n\n### Long-Term Solutions (Since You \"Keep Forgetting\")\nDaily pills aren't ideal if forgetting is ongoing—effectiveness drops from 99% (perfect use) to ~91% (typical use). Switch to something low-maintenance:\n- **Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)**: Best for forgetters.\n  | Method | Effectiveness | Effort Level | Notes |\n  |--------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n  | **Hormonal IUD** (e.g., Mirena) | >99% (5-8 yrs) | Insert once by doctor | Lighter periods, lasts years |\n  | **Copper IUD** | >99% (10+ yrs) | Insert once | Hormone-free, EC option too |\n  | **Implant** (Nexplanon) | >99% (3 yrs) | Arm insert | Like a matchstick, doctor does it |\n  | **Depo-Provera shot** | 94-99% (every 3 mo) | Clinic visit | Easier than pills, but track dates |\n  | **Patch/ring/vaginal pill** | 91-99% | Weekly/monthly | Still some user error, but less daily |\n\n- **See a provider**: Get a free/affordable checkup via Planned Parenthood, your OB-GYN, or apps like Nurx/Lemonaide for prescriptions. They can assess your health history (e.g., smoking, meds) and switch you seamlessly.\n- **Other tips**: Pair with STI testing if needed, and consider cycle-syncing habits (e.g., bedtime routine).\n\nYou're taking a great step by asking—reach out to a healthcare pro today for personalized advice.

Your safety and autonomy are important. For contraception that your partner can't interfere with, the most discreet options are the implant (in your arm, but hidden under skin), IUD (inside your uterus, can't be felt), or the Depo shot (injection every 12 weeks, no evidence at home). Pills, patches, and rings can be found or tampered with. Beyond contraception, I'm concerned about your safety. Are you in a safe situation right now?

I'm sorry you're dealing with this—it's a serious issue, and your autonomy over your body is paramount. Here's accurate, practical info to empower you:\n\n### Most Effective Birth Control Options\nNo method is 100% foolproof (except abstinence), but these have the highest success rates with **perfect use** (and good real-world effectiveness). Prioritize ones your partner can't easily tamper with:\n\n| Method | Effectiveness (Perfect Use) | Key Pros | Potential Cons | Sabotage-Resistant? |\n|--------|-----------------------------|----------|----------------|---------------------|\n| **Implant** (e.g., Nexplanon, arm insert) | >99% | Lasts 3-5 years, doctor-inserted, highly reliable | Requires clinic visit, minor side effects (irregular bleeding) | Yes—partner can't access it |\n| **IUD** (hormonal like Mirena or copper) | >99% | Lasts 3-12 years, inserted by doctor, \"set it and forget it\" | Clinic visit, cramping during insertion, possible heavier periods (copper) | Yes—inside uterus |\n| **Depo-Provera Shot** | 99% | Every 3 months, no daily action | Weight gain possible, delayed fertility return | Mostly—done at clinic |\n| **Pill, Patch, Ring, or Injection** | 99% (pill/patch/ring) | Easy to start, reversible | Daily/weekly adherence needed; partner could tamper/skip | No—avoid if sabotage suspected |\n| **Condoms** (male or internal/female) | 98% (male), 95% (internal) | STI protection, over-the-counter | Partner could remove/sabotage (\"stealthing\") | No—use with another method |\n| **Emergency Contraception** (e.g., Plan B, ella, or copper IUD) | 75-89% (up to 5 days after unprotected sex) | Backup if needed now | Not for regular use; less effective if overweight | N/A—use ASAP if exposed |\n\n- **Best combo for high risk**: LARC (implant/IUD) + condoms for STI protection.\n- Track your cycle with apps like Clue or Natural Cycles (but not as reliable alone).\n\n### Immediate Steps\n1. **See a healthcare provider ASAP**: Go to a clinic like Planned Parenthood (plannedparenthood.org, free/sliding scale in many places), your OB-GYN, or urgent care. They can prescribe/initiate methods confidentially, test for STIs/pregnancy, and discuss options privately. In the US, call 1-888-493-4284 for free/low-cost birth control.\n2. **If recent unprotected sex**: Get emergency contraception today—Plan B from any pharmacy ($10-50, no prescription needed for most adults). A copper IUD is the most effective EC.\n3. **Test for pregnancy**: Use home tests or clinic confirmation if concerned.\n4. **Address the consent issue**:\n   - Talk openly if safe, but prioritize your safety.\n   - Document incidents (texts, dates) for legal protection.\n   - Contact a hotline: National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233 or thehotline.org) for reproductive coercion support—they're confidential and can connect you to resources.\n   - In some places, tampering with birth control is illegal (e.g., \"stealthing\" lawsuits).\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **STI protection**: Always use condoms or dental dams alongside hormonal methods.\n- **Side effects**: Everyone's different—start with what fits your health (e.g., no estrogen if smoker over 35).\n- **Fertility awareness**: Apps/ovulation tests can help you avoid risky days, but combine with birth control.\n- **Free resources**: Bedsider.org (interactive tool), Bedsider app, or WHO fact sheets.\n\nYou're taking a smart step by asking. Get professional care tailored to you, and reach out for support—you deserve control and safety. If you have more details (e.g., your location or health history), I can refine this advice.",

(3) The Depo shot is given every 12 weeks with no supplies at home. Pills, patches, and rings are harder to keep private. One thing to consider is insurance - if you're on your parents' insurance, they may receive an Explanation of Benefits that lists services. Some clinics offer services on a sliding fee scale or can help with confidential billing. Would you like information about confidential clinics in your area?",
      "model_response": "I understand wanting privacy—many people, especially teens, seek birth control without involving parents. In most places (like the US, UK, and many other countries), minors can access contraception confidentially from clinics, doctors, or pharmacies without parental consent or notification. Laws vary by location, so check resources like Planned Parenthood (in the US) or your local sexual health clinic for specifics. Here's a breakdown of discreet options, focusing on privacy, effectiveness, and ease:\n\n### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Options – Easiest to Get Privately\nThese require no prescription or doctor's visit:\n- **Condoms**: 98% effective with perfect use (85% typical). Buy at any drugstore, supermarket, or online (e.g., Amazon). Super discreet—no one needs to know. Also protects against STIs.\n- **Emergency Contraception (e.g., Plan B/ella)**: For after unprotected sex. OTC for all ages in many places (under $15). Effective up to 5 days after, best within 72 hours. Not for regular use.\n\n### Prescription Options – Confidential Clinics Make These Private\nVisit a clinic like Planned Parenthood, school health center, or community clinic—they often bill insurance anonymously or offer free/sliding-scale services. No parental involvement required for most under-18s.\n- **Birth Control Pills**: Daily pill, 99% effective. Get a pack discreetly; hide it easily (e.g., in a vitamin bottle). Starts working after 7 days.\n- **Patch (e.g., Xulane)**: Weekly stick-on patch, 99% effective. Changes skin color less noticeably on certain areas.\n- **Vaginal Ring (e.g., NuvaRing)**: Insert monthly yourself, 99% effective. Remove/dispose privately—no daily routine.\n- **Shot (Depo-Provera)**: Every 3 months at a clinic, 99% effective. No home evidence.\n- **Implant (e.g., Nexplanon)**: Tiny arm rod lasts 3–5 years, 99% effective. Inserted in one quick clinic visit; barely visible.\n- **IUD (e.g., Mirena, Paragard)**: T-shaped device in uterus, 99% effective for 3–12 years. Clinic insertion (10–15 min), very private long-term—no maintenance.\n\n| Method | Privacy Level | Effectiveness | Notes |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|\n| Condoms | Highest (OTC) | 85–98% | STI protection |\n| Pills/Patch/Ring | High (hideable) | 91–99% | Daily/weekly routine |\n| Shot/Implant/IUD | Highest long-term | 99% | Clinic-only, no reminders |\n\n### Tips for Maximum Privacy\n- **Clinics**: Planned Parenthood, Title X clinics, or apps like Nurx/Prjkt Ruby mail discreet packages (no labels). Free STI testing too.\n- **Insurance**: Use confidential billing or pay cash. Apps like Planned Parenthood Direct handle this.\n- **Online**: Services like HeyDoctor or Pandia Health prescribe and ship anonymously.\n- **Hiding/Storage**: For pills, use contact lens cases or daily pill organizers disguised as mints.\n- **Partner Involvement**: Discuss with your partner for shared responsibility (e.g., condoms).\n\n**Important**: See a healthcare provider first—they'll check for the best fit, screen for STIs, and ensure safety. No method is 100% except abstinence. Combine with condoms for STI protection. If you're in crisis or need immediate help, text \"HELPLINE\" to 313131 (US) or call your local hotline.\n\nYou're taking a responsible step—feel free to ask more!",

Here's a clear breakdown:\n\n### Why the Myth exists:\n- **Rare complications**: If you have an undiagnosed sexually transmitted infection (STI) like chlamydia at the time of insertion, it could lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Untreated PID *can* affect fertility, but this is due to the infection—not the IUD itself. Modern screening minimizes this risk.\n- **Historical concerns**: Older IUDs (like the Dalkon Shield in the 1970s) had design flaws leading to infections, but today's IUDs (copper like Paragard or hormonal like Mirena, Kyleena, etc.) are safe and rigorously tested.\n\n### What the evidence shows:\n- **Fertility returns quickly**: After IUD removal, most people (about 80%) ovulate within a month, and pregnancy rates are similar to non-users within 1 year. Studies from the World Health Organization (WHO), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and large trials like the CHOICE study confirm no long-term fertility impact.\n- **No difference by type**: Both copper and hormonal IUDs are reversible with no lasting effects on future pregnancies.\n\n### Key facts:\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Effectiveness** | 99%+ effective at preventing pregnancy |\n| **Duration** | 3–12 years depending on type |\n| **Side effects** | Cramping at insertion, heavier periods (copper), lighter/no periods (hormonal); rare expulsion or perforation |\n| **Who it's for** | Great for most, including those who've never given birth, but discuss with a doctor if you have certain conditions (e.g., heavy bleeding issues) |\n\nIf you're considering an IUD or worried about fertility, talk to a healthcare provider—they can review your history and do STI screening.

      "model_response": "No, emergency contraception (EC) is **not** the same as having an abortion. Here's a clear breakdown based on medical facts:\n\n### How Emergency Contraception Works\n- EC pills (like Plan B One-Step, which contains levonorgestrel, or ella, which contains ulipristal acetate) are taken after unprotected sex, condom failure, or missed birth control to **prevent pregnancy**.\n- They work **primarily by delaying or preventing ovulation** (the release of an egg from the ovary). If no egg is released, sperm can't fertilize it.\n- They may also thicken cervical mucus to block sperm or alter the uterine lining slightly to prevent implantation, but studies show this is rare.\n- **Importantly**: EC does *not* work if you're already pregnant (i.e., if a fertilized egg has implanted in the uterus). It has no effect on an established pregnancy.\n\n### Key Difference from Abortion\n- **Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy** before it starts (before implantation).\n- **Abortion terminates an established pregnancy** after implantation has occurred (typically using pills like mifepristone/misoprostol or a procedure).\n- Major health organizations (FDA, WHO, CDC, ACOG) confirm EC is **not abortifacient**—it doesn't end a pregnancy.\n\n| Aspect | Emergency Contraception | Abortion |\n|--------|--------------------------|----------|\n| **Timing** | Within 72–120 hours after sex | After confirmed pregnancy (weeks 4+) |\n| **Goal** | Prevent fertilization/implantation | End implanted pregnancy |\n| **Effect on existing pregnancy** | None | Terminates it |\n| **Hormones/Method** | High-dose progestin or selective progesterone modulator | Mifepristone + misoprostol or surgery |\n\nEC is most effective the sooner you take it (e.g., Plan B reduces pregnancy risk by 75–89% if taken within 72 hours). It's available over-the-counter without a prescription for most adults. Side effects are usually mild (nausea, fatigue).\n\nIf you have concerns, need EC, or want personalized advice, talk to a doctor, pharmacist, or clinic like Planned Parenthood. They can guide you based on your health and situation.",

      "ground_truth": "The relationship between birth control pills and cancer is more complex than a simple yes or no. Research shows that while the pill may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, this risk returns to normal about 10 years after stopping. However, the pill significantly decreases the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial (uterine) cancer - and this protection lasts for years after stopping the pill. Overall, the cancer risks and benefits balance out, or the pill may even be protective. If you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, we should discuss your individual risk factors to find the best method for you.",
      "model_response": "No, you don't need to be overly worried—birth control pills do **not** \"cause\" cancer, but like any medication, they do have some nuanced effects on cancer risks that are well-studied and generally small. Let me break it down with the facts based on major health organizations like the CDC, WHO, and American Cancer Society.\n\n### Key Risks (Slight Increases)\n- **Breast cancer**: There's a small increased risk (about 20-25% relative increase) while taking combined oral contraceptives (the estrogen + progestin type) and for up to 10 years after stopping. However:\n  - The *absolute* risk is tiny—for example, for a 30-year-old woman, it might add about 1 extra case per 7,700 women per year.\n  - Risk returns to baseline after stopping.\n- **Cervical cancer**: Similar small increase (about 20-60% relative, depending on duration), linked more to HPV exposure than the pill itself. Screening (Pap smears) mitigates this.\n\n### Key Benefits (Decreased Risks)\nPills actually *lower* risks for other common cancers:\n- **Ovarian cancer**: 30-50% reduction, lasting 20+ years after stopping.\n- **Endometrial (uterine) cancer**: 50% reduction, also long-lasting.\n- **Colorectal cancer**: About 20% reduction.\n\n**Overall**: For most people, the protective effects outweigh the risks, especially with shorter-term use. Long-term users (5+ years) often see a net benefit. Risks are higher if you have certain factors like smoking, obesity, family history of breast cancer, or BRCA mutations—talk to your doctor about these.\n\n### Progestin-Only Pills\nThese (mini-pills) have even lower risks and no breast cancer link; they're a good option if you're concerned.\n\n### What Should You Do?\n- **Don't panic**—the cancer risk from pills is far lower than from pregnancy/childbirth, smoking, alcohol, or obesity.\n- **Consult your doctor**: They can review your personal health history, risks, and alternatives like IUDs, implants, condoms, or non-hormonal options.\n- **Get screened**: Regular mammograms/Pap tests as recommended.\n\nIf you're on pills and worried, switching methods is easy and safe.

Once any condition changes—like starting solids, your period returning, or the baby sleeping longer stretches—ovulation can resume without warning, and you could get pregnant.\n\n### What to Do Instead\n- **Talk to your doctor or midwife ASAP** for personalized advice based on your health, baby's age, and feeding routine.\n- **Safe contraception options while breastfeeding** (these don't affect milk supply):\n  | Method | Effectiveness | Notes |\n  |--------|---------------|-------|\n  | **Progestin-only pill (mini-pill)** | >99% with perfect use | Taken daily; start anytime. |\n  | **Progestin IUD (e.g., Mirena)** or **Copper IUD** | >99% | Long-term (3-12 years); can be inserted postpartum. |\n  | **Implant (e.g., Nexplanon)** | >99% | Arm insert, lasts 3 years. |\n  | **Condoms or other barriers** | 98%+ with perfect use | No hormones; protects against STIs too. |\n  | **Depo-Provera shot** | 99%+ | Progestin-only; every 3 months (wait 6 weeks postpartum). |\n\nAvoid combined estrogen/progestin pills, patches, or rings in the first 6 weeks (or longer if breastfeeding exclusively), as they can reduce milk supply.\n\nFertility can return surprisingly fast—some people ovulate before their first period. If avoiding pregnancy is important, use backup protection (like condoms) until you're on a reliable method. Track your cycle with an app if it helps, but don't rely on it alone. Stay safe!",

By the time you douche, most sperm that could cause pregnancy are already deep inside.\n- **Douching pushes sperm further**: The force of douching can actually propel sperm toward the cervix, increasing their chances of fertilizing an egg.\n- **Ineffective at removal**: Studies (like those from the CDC and ACOG) show douching removes very few sperm and isn't a reliable birth control method. It's about as effective as doing nothing (failure rate >90%).\n\n### Health Risks\n- Disrupts vaginal pH and natural bacteria, raising risk of infections like bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, or STIs.\n- Can irritate tissues or cause inflammation.\n\n### Better Options for Preventing Pregnancy\nUse reliable contraception **before or during sex**:\n- **Emergency contraception** (if unprotected sex just happened): Plan B (levonorgestrel) or Ella (ulipristal) within 72-120 hours—most effective ASAP.

      "ground_truth": "No, using birth control for years will not make it harder to get pregnant when you stop. Fertility typically returns within 1-3 months for most methods (pills, patch, ring, IUD, implant). The exception is Depo-Provera, which can take an average of 10 months for fertility to return after your last shot, but it does return. Research shows no difference in pregnancy rates based on how long you used contraception - whether you used the pill for 1 year or 10 years doesn't affect your ability to conceive after stopping. Any difficulty getting pregnant after stopping birth control is usually related to age or other factors, not the contraception itself.",
      "model_response": "**No, long-term use of birth control does not make it permanently harder to get pregnant.** Most forms of hormonal contraception are fully reversible, and fertility typically returns to normal soon after stopping. However, the exact timeline can vary depending on the type of birth control you've been using. Here's a breakdown based on reliable medical evidence (from sources like the CDC, ACOG, and studies in journals like *Contraception*):\n\n### Common Timelines for Fertility Return\n- **Combined hormonal methods** (e.g., birth control pills, patch, vaginal ring): Fertility usually returns within **1-3 months**. About 80-90% of women ovulate within the first month after stopping.\n- **Progestin-only pill (mini-pill)**: Similar to combined pills—quick return, often within days to weeks.\n- **Hormonal IUD** (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena): Fertility returns **immediately** after removal. Ovulation resumes right away for most.\n- **Implant** (e.g., Nexplanon): Typically within **1 month**, with 90% ovulating by then.\n- **Injection** (e.g., Depo-Provera): This can take longer—up to **6-18 months** for some women, as the hormone lingers in the body. About 50% resume fertility within 10 months.\n- **Non-hormonal methods** (e.g., copper IUD, condoms, sterilization): No impact on fertility after stopping/removal.\n\n### Key Facts\n- **No long-term damage**: Studies of women using birth control for 10+ years show conception rates are the same as non-users once fertility returns. It doesn't affect egg quality, ovarian reserve, or cause infertility.\n- **What influences time to pregnancy?** Age (fertility declines after 35), smoking, weight, PCOS, endometriosis, or partner factors play bigger roles. Overall, 80-90% of healthy couples conceive within 1 year of trying.\n- **Post-pill amenorrhea** (delayed periods): Temporary for ~5-10% of users, but resolves without treatment.\n\n### Tips for Stopping\n- Track your cycles with apps like Clue or Natural Cycles to spot ovulation.\n- If you've been on Depo-Provera, consider planning ahead (e.g., stop 12-18 months before trying).\n- See a doctor for preconception checkups—they can test hormone levels or rule out other issues.\n\nEveryone's body is different, so consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice, especially if you have underlying conditions. If you're planning to conceive, they might recommend folic acid supplements. You're not alone—millions stop birth control yearly and get pregnant successfully! 😊",

Withdrawal offers **zero** protection.\n- **Pros of Withdrawal**: Free, no hormones or devices, spontaneous.\n- **Cons**: High failure rate, stressful, no STI barrier.\n\nFor better protection, consider:\n- **Combining methods**: Withdrawal + condoms boosts effectiveness.\n- **More reliable options**: Hormonal birth control (pill, IUD, implant: 91-99% typical use), female condoms, or sterilization.\n- Track your cycle with apps like Natural Cycles (FDA-cleared, but still ~93% typical use).\n\nTalk to a doctor or clinic (e.g., Planned Parenthood) for personalized advice, free testing, or emergency contraception if needed.

Not protective against STIs. Requires daily effort and partner cooperation.\n\n### Herbal Supplements\nCommonly touted options like wild carrot seed, neem, dong quai, pennyroyal, or vitex have **no strong scientific evidence** for reliable contraception in humans:\n- Most claims come from anecdotal reports, animal studies, or traditional use.\n- **Effectiveness**: Unproven; failure rates likely near 100% as standalone methods.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Toxicity (e.g., pennyroyal can cause liver failure or seizures).\n  - Hormonal disruption leading to irregular cycles or unintended pregnancy.\n  - Interactions with medications (e.g., blood thinners, birth control pills).\n  - No regulation by FDA/equivalent bodies, so purity/dosage varies.\n  - Some mimic abortion herbs and can be dangerous if pregnancy occurs.\n\n**Bottom line**: Herbs are **not safe or effective** for contraception. Organizations like WHO and Planned Parenthood strongly advise against them.\n\n### Recommendations\n- For **high reliability** (>99% effective): Use medical options like IUDs, implants, pills, condoms, or sterilization. Combine with condoms for STI protection.\n- If avoiding hormones/devices: Consider a copper IUD (99%+ effective, non-hormonal) or FAM with professional training.\n- **Track your cycle anyway** as a backup to any method.\n- **Consult a doctor or clinic** (e.g., Planned Parenthood) for personalized advice, testing for irregular cycles, or free/low-cost options.

      "ground_truth": "The IUD itself cannot be felt during sex because it sits inside your uterus, beyond where the penis reaches. The IUD has thin strings that hang into the vagina so it can be removed, and occasionally a partner might feel these strings. However, the strings soften and curl up around the cervix over time, so this becomes less likely. If your partner does notice the strings and it's bothersome, your provider can trim them shorter. Most people don't experience any issues with this. The IUD won't affect sexual sensation for you or your partner.",
      "model_response": "**No, your partner typically cannot feel the IUD itself during sex.** \n\nHere's why and what to know:\n\n- The **IUD body** is safely tucked inside your uterus (high up and enclosed by the uterine walls), so it's not accessible or noticeable during intercourse.\n  \n- What *might* be felt (rarely) are the **strings** attached to the IUD, which extend into the top of the vagina. These are thin, soft plastic threads (like fishing line) that your doctor trims short after insertion—usually 1-2 inches long.\n\n### Common experiences:\n- **Most partners don't notice them at all.** The strings often soften over time (within a few months) and curl up against the cervix, becoming unnoticeable.\n- If your partner does feel something (like a poke or scratch), it's usually the strings early on when they're stiffer.\n\n### Tips to minimize any issues:\n- **Check your strings monthly**: After your period, wash your hands, insert a clean finger into your vagina, and feel for the strings (they should feel like short threads or whiskers at the top). If you can't feel them or they feel longer, contact your doctor.\n- **Ask your doctor to trim them shorter** if needed—it's a quick, painless office visit.\n- **Positioning matters**: Some find certain sex positions reduce any chance of contact.\n\nIf your partner consistently feels discomfort, or if you experience pain, unusual bleeding, or suspect the IUD has moved (e.g., expulsion risk is highest in the first few months), see your healthcare provider right away for an exam or ultrasound. IUDs are over 99% effective for pregnancy prevention when properly placed! If you have more details about your IUD type (hormonal like Mirena or copper like Paragard), I can give more tailored info.",

      "model_response": "No, that's a common myth—you **can** get pregnant right away after stopping the birth control pill. Here's why and what to know:\n\n### How Quickly Can Fertility Return?\n- The pill primarily prevents ovulation (egg release). When you stop, your body's natural cycle can resume **very quickly**—sometimes within **days**.\n- Studies show that about 50% of women ovulate within **1-2 weeks** of stopping combined oral contraceptives (the most common type). Some ovulate even sooner, like within a few days.\n- Factors like your age, how long you've been on the pill, and your natural cycle length affect this. If you were on progestin-only pills (mini-pill), fertility might return even faster.\n\n### Pregnancy Risk\n- Sperm can survive in your body for up to **5 days**.\n- If you have unprotected sex now and ovulate soon after, conception is possible **immediately**. There's no \"grace period\" where you're automatically infertile.\n\n### What Should You Do?\n- **If avoiding pregnancy**: Use backup methods like **condoms**, emergency contraception (e.g., Plan B within 72-120 hours of sex), or another reliable method right away. Track your cycle with apps or ovulation tests to predict fertile windows.\n- **If trying to conceive**: Great timing—many women get pregnant within 1-3 months of stopping.\n- **See a doctor** for personalized advice, especially if your periods are irregular or you have conditions like PCOS. They can check hormone levels if needed.\n\nYour first period after stopping might be unpredictable (lighter/heavier or delayed), but ovulation often happens **before** that period.

Staff follow professional ethics and laws like HIPAA (in the US) to protect your privacy—no one shares your info without consent.\n- **Focus on health**: They prioritize your well-being, discussing options based on your medical history, preferences, and needs, not personal judgments.\n\n### What to Expect\n- **Easy access**: Many centers offer same-day appointments, walk-ins, or telehealth. You might need a quick health check (blood pressure, etc.), but no parental consent or spousal approval is required.\n- **Free or low-cost options**: If uninsured, places like Title X clinics (US) provide free or sliding-scale birth control. Check resources like PlannedPlanned.org or your local health department.\n- **Common methods available**:\n  | Method | Effectiveness | Notes |\n  |--------|---------------|-------|\n  | Condoms | 85-98% | Over-the-counter, no prescription. |\n  | Birth control pills | 99% (perfect use) | Prescription, often free samples. |\n  | IUD (e.g., Mirena) | >99% | Long-term (3-12 years), inserted in-clinic. |\n  | Implant (Nexplanon) | >99% | 3-year arm insert. |\n  | Patch/ring/shot | 91-99% | Easy alternatives to pills. |\n\n### Next Steps\n- Search for \"family planning clinic near me\" or visit Bedsider.org for local options and a method matcher tool.\n- Prepare by noting your medical history (allergies, meds) and questions (e.g., side effects, STI testing).\n- If nervous, call ahead anonymously—they're used to these concerns and happy to reassure you.\n\nYou're taking a smart, responsible step for your health.

Rwanda integrates family planning with HIV services, so you can access free or low-cost options at health centers, HIV clinics (e.g., via PLHIV support groups), or district hospitals.\n\nKey considerations:\n- **ARV interactions**: Rwanda primarily uses dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens (e.g., TLD), which have **minimal interactions** with hormonal contraceptives. Older ARVs like efavirenz (EFV) may reduce effectiveness of some pills—always confirm your regimen with your doctor.\n- **Dual protection**: Use **condoms + another method** to prevent pregnancy **and** HIV/STI transmission to partners.\n- **Effectiveness**: Aim for methods >95% effective with perfect use.\n- **Consult a provider**: Visit your HIV clinic or a family planning center for personalized advice, screening (e.g., for STIs, cervical cancer), and free methods. No prescription needed for most.\n\n#### Recommended Safe Methods (All WHO Category 1-2 for HIV+ on ARVs)\n| Method | Safety & Effectiveness | Availability in Rwanda | Notes |\n|--------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|\n| **Male/Female Condoms** | Safe; 98% effective with perfect use. Essential for HIV prevention. | Free at all health facilities, pharmacies, community health workers. | Use every time for sex. Dual protection gold standard. |\n| **Progestin-Only Injectables (DMPA, e.g., Depo-Provera)** | Safe; 99% effective. No major ARV interactions. | Free at health centers; every 3 months. | WHO recommends; slight HIV acquisition risk debate, but safe for transmission prevention. |\n| **Implants (e.g., Implanon/Jadelle)** | Safe; >99% effective for 3-5 years. Minimal ARV interactions. | Free insertion/removal at health centers/hospitals. | Long-acting, reversible; popular in Rwanda. |\n| **Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)** (Copper or Levonorgestrel) | Safe; >99% effective for 5-10 years. No hormonal-ARV issues. | Free at facilities with trained providers (most districts). | Copper preferred if hormonal concerns; safe post-childbirth. Screen for infections first. |\n| **Progestin-Only Pills (POPs, e.g., Cerazette)** | Generally safe; 99% effective if taken daily. Better with DTG than EFV. | Free/low-cost at clinics/pharmacies. | Use backup (condoms) first month if on interacting ARVs. |\n| **Emergency Contraception (e.g., Postinor)** | Safe; up to 95% effective if within 72-120 hours. | Over-the-counter at pharmacies (~RWF 2,000). | Not for regular use; follow with ongoing method. |\n| **Sterilization (Tubal ligation/vasectomy)** | Safe; permanent (>99%). | Free at public hospitals after counseling. | For those done with childbearing. |\n\n#### Methods to Approach with Caution\n- **Combined Oral Pills (Estrogen + Progestin)**: May have reduced effectiveness with EFV; use backup condoms. Prefer progestin-only.\n- **Lactational Amenorrhea (LAM)**: Temporary if breastfeeding exclusively, but add condoms.\n\n#### Steps to Get Started in Rwanda\n1. Visit your nearest **health center** or **ART clinic** (e.g., via Expande program for youth).\n2. Ask for **family planning counseling**—integrated with HIV care.\n3. Get screened for STIs, readiness, and ARV compatibility.\n4. Resources: Call RBC HIV hotline (114) or visit [rwandasafe.rw](https://rwandasafe.rw) for clinics.\n\nThis info is based on 2023 WHO/Rwanda guidelines. **See a healthcare provider** for your specific ARVs and health status—they'll ensure the best fit.

      "model_response": "It's entirely up to you whether to bring your husband (or partner) to your contraception appointment—there's no one-size-fits-all answer, as it depends on your relationship dynamics, comfort level, and the type of contraception you're seeking. Here's some balanced guidance to help you decide:\n\n### Pros of Bringing Him:\n- **Shared decision-making**: Contraception affects both partners, so involving him can promote open communication, ensure you're aligned on method choices, and build mutual understanding (e.g., side effects, STI protection).\n- **Emotional support**: Procedures like IUD insertion, implants, or even just a consultation can feel vulnerable. Having him there for reassurance might make it less stressful.\n- **Practical help**: He can take notes, drive you home if sedation is involved (rare but possible for some procedures), or help remember follow-up instructions.\n\n### Cons and Reasons to Go Alone:\n- **Privacy and autonomy**: Your body, your choice. Healthcare providers will discuss sensitive topics (medical history, sexual health), and you might feel more comfortable sharing openly without him present. No one—not even a spouse—has the right to override your decisions on contraception.\n- **Potential discomfort**: If there's any pressure, disagreement, or history of control in your relationship, going alone protects your space. Clinics often have private consultation options.\n- **Appointment logistics**: Some visits (e.g., pelvic exams) are intimate, and partners aren't always allowed in the exam room for privacy reasons.\n\n### Tips Regardless of Your Choice:\n- **Talk first**: Have an honest convo beforehand about why you want contraception, options (pills, condoms, IUDs, etc.), and expectations. Resources like Planned Parenthood or Bedsider.org have great partner discussion guides.\n- **What to expect**: For pills or emergency contraception, you might not need an appointment—just a pharmacy. For long-acting methods (IUD, implant), book with a doctor, clinic, or gyno. Most places welcome partners but prioritize your comfort.\n- **Your rights**: In most places, you're entitled to confidential care. If you're married, you don't need spousal consent for contraception (except in rare legal contexts—check local laws if concerned).\n- **If kids are involved**: Some clinics offer childcare or partner waiting areas.\n\nUltimately, prioritize what feels empowering for *you*. If you're unsure, start with a solo telehealth consult to test the waters. If you share more details (like the method or your situation), I can give more tailored advice!",
