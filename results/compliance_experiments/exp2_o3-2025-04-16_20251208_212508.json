      "ground_truth": "It's important to know which type of birth control pill you're considering. Combined oral contraceptives (pills containing both estrogen and progestin) are not recommended in the first 6 weeks after giving birth while breastfeeding, as they may reduce your milk supply. However, progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills) are safe to use while breastfeeding and won't affect your milk. Other good options include the copper IUD, contraceptive implant, or barrier methods like condoms. I'd recommend discussing with your healthcare provider which option works best for you.",
      "model_response": "Congratulations on the birth of your baby, and thank you for seeking information before choosing a method. I’ll give you evidence-based facts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Rwanda’s national policy so you can decide what is best for you. Please feel free to stop me at any time or ask for clarification.\n\n1. Which types of “birth-control pills” exist?\n   • Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) – contain both estrogen and progestin  \n   • Progestin-only pills (POPs, sometimes called the “mini-pill”) – contain only progestin\n\n2. Medical eligibility while you are breastfeeding a 3-week-old baby\n   • COCs: WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Category 4 for breastfeeding women less than 6 weeks postpartum. Category 4 means the risks clearly outweigh any benefit, so they are NOT recommended now. (Reasons: possible reduction in milk supply and increased risk of blood clots at this stage.)\n   • POPs: WHO MEC Category 2 for breastfeeding women less than 6 weeks postpartum. Category 2 means the method can generally be used because any theoretical risk is outweighed by the advantages. Therefore, you may start POPs now if you wish and have no other contraindications.\n\n3. Effectiveness of pills (first-year pregnancy rates)\n   • POPs (typical use): about 7 pregnancies per 100 women (93 % effective)  \n     POPs (perfect use): <1 pregnancy per 100 women (>99 % effective)  \n   • COCs have similar effectiveness but, as noted, are not appropriate for you at the moment.\n\n   Remember: pills prevent pregnancy only while you take them correctly; they do NOT protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms can be added for dual protection.\n\n4. How to start POPs now (if you choose them)\n   • You can start today or any day. No backup method is needed if you are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding and have had no menstrual bleeding yet. If you are partially breastfeeding or unsure, use condoms or abstain for 48 hours after the first pill.\n   • Take one pill every day, at the same time of day. Taking a pill more than 3 hours late reduces protection; if that happens, take the missed pill as soon as you remember and use condoms or abstain for the next 48 hours.\n\n5. Possible side-effects of POPs (usually mild and improve within a few months)\n   • Irregular spotting or bleeding, or sometimes no bleeding at all  \n   • Headache, dizziness, mild breast tenderness, mood changes or acne in some women  \n   • These effects are not harmful, but if they bother you, come back for help or consider another method.\n\n6. Warning signs – seek care immediately if you notice\n   • Severe abdominal pain (possible ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst, or infection)  \n   • Very heavy vaginal bleeding  \n   • Yellowing of the eyes or skin (possible liver problem)  \n   • Swelling or severe pain in one leg (although rare with POPs)  \n   • Any time you think you might be pregnant\n\n7. Other family-planning options you might also consider\n   • Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM): up to 98 % effective until 6 months postpartum if you are exclusively breastfeeding, have no menses, and feed at least every 4 hours by day and every 6 hours by night.  \n   • Implants or the hormonal IUD: can be inserted any time postpartum for breastfeeding women (MEC 2).  \n   • Copper IUD: can be inserted from 4 weeks postpartum (MEC 1) or within 48 hours of delivery.  \n   • Injectable DMPA: WHO MEC Category 2 for breastfeeding women less than 6 weeks postpartum; possible option now or at 6 weeks.  \n   • Condoms, diaphragms, or permanent methods (tubal ligation/vasectomy) when appropriate.\n\n8. Access and cost in Rwanda\n   • Family-planning services, including POPs, are free or very low-cost at public health centres and through community health workers.  \n   • You do NOT need anyone’s permission, even if you are young or unmarried.  \n   • If you prefer privacy, you can ask for counseling in a separate room.\n\n9. Next steps\n   • If you feel POPs match your needs, visit your nearest health centre or community health worker to receive a pack and detailed instructions.  \n   • If you prefer to wait or consider other methods, that is also fine. You are in control of the decision.  \n   • Schedule a follow-up or come sooner if you experience problems, have questions, or want to change methods.\n\nWould you like more information about POPs, other methods, or how to access services?",

      "ground_truth": "This is an important safety concern. Combined oral contraceptives (pills with both estrogen and progestin) should NOT be used if you have migraines with aura, as they significantly increase your risk of stroke. However, progestin-only pills, the implant, IUD, or injection are safe alternatives that won't increase stroke risk. Some of these options may also help with cramps. Please discuss this with your healthcare provider to find a safe method that addresses both your contraceptive needs and menstrual symptoms.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing that you experience migraine with aura and that you are considering birth-control pills to help with menstrual cramps. Let’s look at what the evidence says and explore options that are both effective and safe for you.\n\n1. How migraine with aura affects the safety of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs)\n• According to the 2022 WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), “migraine with aura, at any age” is MEC Category 4 for combined hormonal contraceptives (which include the regular birth-control pill, the weekly patch and the monthly vaginal ring).  \n  – Category 4 means “unacceptable health risk—method should not be used.”  \n  – The main concern is a higher risk of stroke in people who have migraine with aura and use estrogen-containing methods.\n\nTherefore, the standard combined pill is not considered safe for you.\n\n2. Other methods that can help with cramps and are compatible with migraine with aura\nBelow are methods that are MEC Category 1 or 2 for migraine with aura, meaning they are generally safe to use. Effectiveness figures show typical-use pregnancy rates in the first year, followed by perfect-use rates in parentheses.\n\nHormonal, progestin-only options (MEC 2 for migraine with aura)\n• Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, e.g., Mirena or 5-year type)  \n  – Effectiveness: 0.1% (0.1%)  \n  – Often decreases bleeding and cramping over time.  \n  – Side effects: irregular spotting in the first months, lighter periods later, rarely benign ovarian cysts.  \n  – Warning signs (PAINS): Period late or abnormal bleeding after amenorrhea, Abdominal pain/severe cramping, Infection exposure, Not feeling well (fever, chills), Strings missing/shorter or longer.\n\n• Progestin-only implant (e.g., Implanon, Nexplanon)  \n  – Effectiveness: 0.1% (0.05%)  \n  – May reduce cramps for many users.  \n  – Side effects: unpredictable bleeding, lighter bleeding or amenorrhea.  \n  – Warning signs: swelling/redness at insertion site, severe lower-abdominal pain (possible ovarian cyst rupture), pregnancy symptoms.\n\n• Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injection every 3 months  \n  – Effectiveness: 4% (0.2%)  \n  – Many users have less cramping after several injections; some become amenorrheic.  \n  – Side effects: weight change, delayed return to fertility, possible decrease in bone mineral density (usually reversible).  \n  – Warning signs: signs of pregnancy, heavy bleeding, severe headaches that are new or worsening.\n\n• Progestin-only pill (POP, daily “mini-pill,” 28 pills per pack)  \n  – Effectiveness: 7–9% (0.3%)  \n  – Must be taken at the same time every day; more forgiving with drospirenone POPs but still daily.  \n  – May lessen cramps for some users.  \n  – Side effects: irregular spotting, breast tenderness.  \n  – Warning signs: very heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, suspected pregnancy.\n\nNon-hormonal options\n• Copper IUD (MEC 1 for migraine with aura)  \n  – Effectiveness: 0.8% (0.6%)  \n  – Important note: Copper IUDs can increase menstrual bleeding and cramping, especially in the first few months, so it might not be the best choice if pain relief is a primary goal.\n\n• Barrier methods (male or female condoms, diaphragm)  \n  – Condoms also prevent STIs.  \n  – Typical-use effectiveness: 13% (2%) for male condoms.  \n\n• Fertility awareness or withdrawal  \n  – These have higher typical-use failure rates (12–20%+) and do not directly influence cramps.\n\n3. What you might consider next\n• Discuss the progestin-only methods or the LNG-IUS with your healthcare provider. They are safe with migraine with aura and often improve period pain.  \n• If heavy cramps remain a problem, you can also use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, which are compatible with all the contraceptive methods listed above (unless you have another medical contraindication).\n\n4. Access and confidentiality in Rwanda\n• By national policy, you are entitled to family-planning services regardless of age or marital status. No parental or partner consent is needed.  \n• Services are offered free or at low cost in public facilities, and your consultation is confidential.\n\n5. When to seek medical attention (general danger signs for any hormonal method)\n• New, severe or worsening headaches or any neurological symptoms (especially since you already have migraine with aura)  \n• Sudden chest pain or shortness of breath  \n• Severe abdominal pain  \n• Heavy or prolonged vaginal bleeding  \n• Signs of pregnancy or if you miss a period after 6 weeks on an LNG-IUS or implant\n\n6. Your autonomy\nThe final choice is yours. My role is to provide clear, evidence-based information so you can decide what fits best with your health needs and lifestyle. If you’d like, we can review each method in more detail, or you may discuss these options further with your doctor.\n\nLet me know how else I can support you.",

However, you have several safe and effective alternatives: the copper IUD (hormone-free, >99% effective), progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, or if you've completed your family, sterilization. The most important thing is to work with your doctor to control your blood pressure while choosing a contraceptive method that's safe for you.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing this information. I will give you facts from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy. Please feel free to ask more questions at any time.\n\n1. Can you safely use combined birth-control pills (also called “the pill,” containing both estrogen and progestin)?\n   • According to the WHO MEC, severe hypertension—systolic ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 100 mmHg—is MEC Category 4 for all combined hormonal methods (combined pills, patch, vaginal ring).  \n   • Category 4 means “unacceptable health risk—do not use.”  \n   • Therefore, with a blood pressure of 160/100, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended for you.\n\n2. What about progestin-only pills (POPs)?\n   • For severe hypertension, POPs are MEC Category 3.  \n   • Category 3 means “the method is usually not recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or acceptable.”  \n   • If no other option suits you, a qualified provider could still consider POPs, but they are not the first choice. Your blood pressure would need close follow-up.\n\n3. Safer alternatives you might consider\n   (All are MEC Category 1 or 2 for severe hypertension unless otherwise noted.)\n   • Copper IUD (non-hormonal)  \n        – MEC Category 1 (safe).  \n        – Effectiveness: Perfect use ≈ 99.4 %; typical use ≈ 99.2 % (about 0.8 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).  \n        – Works for up to 10–12 years; can be removed any time.  \n   • Male or female condoms  \n        – No medical restrictions.  \n        – Typical use ≈ 87 % effective; perfect use ≈ 98 % (male condom).  \n        – Also protect against STIs, including HIV.  \n   • Permanent methods  \n        – Female sterilisation or male vasectomy are MEC Category 1.  \n        – Failure rate < 0.5 % in typical use.  \n   • Fertility awareness-based methods  \n        – MEC Category 1.  \n        – Typical effectiveness ranges 77–88 %; perfect use up to > 95 %.  \n        – Require careful daily tracking and partner cooperation.  \n   • Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, implants, or injectables  \n        – Severe hypertension is MEC Category 3 for these methods; they are possible but not preferred.  \n        – Would need individual clinical judgment and regular blood-pressure monitoring.\n\n4. Common side-effects and warning signs (example: Copper IUD)\n   • Expected side-effects: Heavier or longer periods, more cramps (usually improve after a few months).  \n   • Serious warning signs (rare): Very heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, foul-smelling discharge, missed period with pregnancy symptoms, or fever/chills. Seek care promptly if these occur.\n\n5. When to seek care immediately, whichever method you choose\n   • Severe headache, visual changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, swelling of legs, or any sudden worsening of blood pressure symptoms.  \n   • For any method-specific danger signs explained by your provider.  \n\n6. Managing your blood pressure\n   • It is important to have your hypertension evaluated and treated. Effective blood-pressure control may widen your contraceptive options in the future.  \n   • Lifestyle changes (salt reduction, healthy diet, exercise) and/or medication may be advised by your clinician.\n\n7. Access in Rwanda\n   • Under the 2021 National Family Planning Policy, all women—including unmarried women and adolescents—may access contraception without partner or parental consent.  \n   • Family-planning services (including IUDs and sterilisation) are free or offered at low cost in public facilities and many community health centres.  \n   • You can request a private, confidential consultation.\n\n8. Next steps\n   • Consider visiting a health centre or qualified provider to:  \n        – Have your blood pressure confirmed and managed.  \n        – Review the Copper IUD or another suitable method.  \n        – Receive counselling on insertion, removal, side-effects, and follow-up.  \n   • Bring any questions or concerns; the final choice is always yours.\n\nIf anything is unclear or if you would like more details on any method, let me know.

      "ground_truth": "With current breast cancer, you should not use any hormonal contraception (pills, injection, implant, or hormonal IUD) as breast cancer is hormone-sensitive and these methods could potentially affect your treatment outcomes. Your best options are the copper IUD, which is >99% effective and hormone-free, or barrier methods like condoms or a diaphragm. The copper IUD is particularly recommended as it's highly effective and won't interfere with your cancer treatment. Please coordinate with your oncology team when choosing and placing a contraceptive method.",
      "model_response": "I am sorry you are going through cancer treatment. I will give you information that is consistent with the 2022 WHO Family Planning Guidance, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) and the Balanced Counseling Strategy. You can use it to choose the method that best suits you, together with your oncology and family-planning providers.  \n\nKey point first  \n• While you have breast cancer (whether it is receptor-positive or not) ALL hormonal contraceptives are medically contraindicated (WHO MEC Category 4 = “unacceptable health risk”).  \n• Non-hormonal methods remain available and safe for you (MEC Category 1 = “no restriction” unless another condition is present).  \n\nBelow are your options, their effectiveness and important considerations.\n\n1. Copper-bearing intra-uterine device (Cu-IUD)  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use failure ≈ 0.8 pregnancies/100 women in the first year (> 99 % effective); perfect use ≈ 0.6.  \n   • Eligibility with breast cancer: MEC 1 (safe).  \n   • How it works: Releases copper ions that impair sperm and prevent fertilisation; no hormones.  \n   • Advantages: Highly effective, long-acting (12 years or more depending on type), immediately reversible, privacy, no user action after insertion, safe while on chemotherapy or radiotherapy.*  \n   • Possible side-effects: Heavier or more painful periods, especially in first months.  \n   • Warning signs (“PAINS”): Period abnormalities (late/abnormal bleeding), Abdominal pain, Infection exposure (STI risk), Not feeling well (fever, chills), Strings missing or shorter/longer.  \n   • When to seek care: If you have severe lower-abdominal pain, fever, very heavy bleeding, foul vaginal discharge, or can’t feel the strings.  \n   • Practical points in Rwanda: Available free or at low cost in public facilities. Insertion requires trained provider; you can usually have it placed any time pregnancy is reasonably excluded. *If your chemotherapy severely suppresses immunity or platelets, your provider may delay insertion until counts recover (MEC 2).  \n\n2. Male or female condoms  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use ≈ 13–21 % failure first year; perfect use 2 % (male) or 5 % (female).  \n   • Added value: Only method that also protects against HIV/STIs.  \n   • Side-effects: None systemic; some people report latex irritation (switch to polyurethane or polyisoprene).  \n   • Tips for effectiveness: Use a new condom every act, put on before any genital contact, use water-based lubricant, store away from heat.  \n\n3. Diaphragm with spermicide / cervical cap  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use ≈ 17–21 % failure; perfect ≈ 6 %.  \n   • Not commonly available everywhere in Rwanda; you need fitting by trained staff.  \n\n4. Fertility Awareness-Based Methods (FABMs) such as Standard Days, TwoDay, symptothermal or calendar methods  \n   • Effectiveness (typical): 12–24 % failure; perfect: 1–5 %.  \n   • Require daily record-keeping, partner cooperation, and the ability to abstain or use condoms during fertile days.  \n   • Chemotherapy can make cycles irregular; that can reduce reliability of FABMs.  \n\n5. Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM)  \n   • Only for women who delivered <6 months ago, are fully/near-fully breastfeeding, and have no menses. Effectiveness ~ 2 % failure.  \n   • If any criterion fails, switch immediately to another method (e.g., condoms plus Cu-IUD).  \n\n6. Permanent contraception  \n   • Female sterilisation (tubal ligation or mini-lap) or male partner vasectomy.  \n   • Effectiveness: > 99 %.  \n   • Suitable if you are certain you do not want any (more) children.  \n   • In Rwanda, these services are offered free/low-cost in public facilities.  \n   • Requires consent; considered irreversible.  \n\nMethods you should AVOID while you have breast cancer (WHO MEC 4)  \n• All combined hormonal methods (pills, injectables, patch, vaginal ring)  \n• All progestin-only methods (implants, progestin-only pills, DMPA or NET-EN injectables, levonorgestrel IUS)  \n• Emergency contraception containing LNG or ulipristal acetate (use copper IUD instead if needed).  \n\nEmergency contraception for you  \n• Copper IUD within 5 days of unprotected sex is highly effective (> 99 %) and is safe with breast cancer (MEC 1).  \n\nQuestions you may wish to discuss with your providers  \n1. Is my blood count/infection risk okay for immediate Cu-IUD insertion?  \n2. Would a permanent method be best considering my future childbearing plans?  \n3. How will chemotherapy or radiotherapy influence my periods and my ability to rely on fertility-awareness methods?  \n\nWhere to obtain services in Rwanda  \n• Public health centres and district hospitals provide Cu-IUDs, condoms and permanent methods at no cost or minimal cost.  \n• Adolescents and single women are legally entitled to these services without parental or spousal consent.  \n\nKey take-home messages  \n• Pregnancy during breast-cancer treatment is risky for you and the fetus; effective contraception is important.  \n• Non-hormonal methods—especially the copper IUD or a permanent method—are the safest and most effective choices while you are undergoing treatment.  \n• Condoms can be used alone (less effective) or in addition to another method for dual protection against STIs.  \n• You can switch to other methods later if your oncologist confirms you are cancer-free for at least 5 years (hormonal methods become MEC 3 at that stage).  \n• Seek care promptly if you experience any warning signs after IUD insertion or with any method.  \n\nIf anything is unclear or you have other health conditions, please discuss further with your oncology team or a trained family-planning provider.",

Having had a stroke means you have a significantly increased risk of having another one, and combined pills would raise that risk even more. However, you have safe and effective alternatives: progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, the injection, or the copper IUD are all appropriate options. I'd recommend discussing with your healthcare provider which method works best given your overall health situation.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing this important information about your health history. I will give you evidence-based information from the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) and the 2022 Family Planning Global Handbook so you can decide what is best for you.\n\n1. What the WHO MEC says about stroke and “the pill”  \n• Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) contain both estrogen and progestin.  \n  – Past or current cerebro-vascular accident (stroke) is MEC Category 4 for COCs.  \n  – Category 4 means “unacceptable health risk—do not use.”  \n• Progestin-only pills (POPs, sometimes called the “mini-pill”) do not contain estrogen.  \n  – History of stroke is MEC Category 3 for POPs.  \n  – Category 3 means “the risks usually outweigh the benefits.” A specialist would need to judge whether exceptional circumstances make POPs acceptable for you; in most cases another method is preferred.\n\n2. Why estrogen-containing pills are not safe after a stroke  \nEstrogen can increase the tendency of the blood to clot. After a stroke, any extra clotting risk is considered unacceptable.\n\n3. Effectiveness of other methods you could consider  \n(Effectiveness figures are for typical use / perfect use.)  \nHighly effective, non-estrogen options that are generally safe after stroke:  \n• Copper IUD (MEC 1): >99.2 % / 99.9 %  \n• Male or female sterilisation (permanent): >99 %  \n• Lactational Amenorrhoea Method – if fully breastfeeding and baby <6 months: 98 % / 99+ %  \n\nOther options that may be acceptable with specialist assessment (MEC 3):  \n• Progestin-only implant: 99.2 % / 99.9 %  \n• Progestin injection (DMPA or NET-EN): 94 % / 99.8 %  \nNote: Because stroke is MEC 3 for these methods, a clinician should weigh benefits against risks in your specific case.\n\nBarrier and behavioural methods (no medical restrictions):  \n• Male condoms: 87 % / 98 % (also protect against STIs)  \n• Female condoms: 79 % / 95 %  \n• Diaphragm, fertility awareness, withdrawal, etc.: 77 % or less / up to 95–98 % with perfect use\n\n4. Emergency contraception (EC)  \n• Levonorgestrel EC pills: MEC 1 for stroke history; can be taken within 120 hours but the sooner the better.  \n• Copper IUD used as EC within 5 days: MEC 1 and provides ongoing contraception.\n\n5. Side effects and warning signs for key alternatives  \nCopper IUD  \n• Common: Heavier or more painful periods in first 3–6 months.  \n• Go to a clinic urgently if you have severe lower-abdominal pain, fever, very heavy bleeding, or you cannot feel the strings.  \n\nProgestin-only implant or injection (if a specialist decides it is suitable)  \n• Common: Irregular bleeding or no bleeding.  \n• Seek care if you have very heavy bleeding, severe migraine, or any neurological symptom.  \n\n6. Access in Rwanda  \n• Public health centres provide most methods free or at low cost.  \n• Adolescents and single women may obtain contraception without parental or partner consent.  \n• You can ask for a referral to a district hospital for long-acting or permanent methods if not available at the health post.\n\n7. Next steps  \n• Because of your stroke history, combined oral contraceptives are not safe for you.  \n• Discuss non-estrogen options—especially the copper IUD or, if a specialist agrees, a progestin-only method—with a qualified provider.  \n• Bring any medical records you have about the stroke to help the provider assess your cardiovascular risk.  \n\n8. When to seek immediate medical care (regardless of the method you choose)  \n• Sudden weakness or numbness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side  \n• Sudden severe headache with no known cause  \n• Trouble speaking, understanding, or seeing  \n• Chest pain or shortness of breath  \n\nIf you notice any of these, go to the nearest hospital or call emergency services right away.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision. You are welcome to ask more questions or discuss any concerns.",

      "scenario": "I'm 16 years old and considering the Depo-Provera shot. Is that a good choice?",
      "ground_truth": "Depo-Provera can be used at your age and is very effective (>99%), but there's something important to discuss: it can affect bone density while you're still building bone strength during adolescence. This is usually not a major concern for short-term use (under 2 years), and bone density typically returns to normal after stopping. Other methods like the implant or IUD are also very effective and don't have this concern. You might also consider pills or the ring. Would you like to discuss the pros and cons of these options to see which best fits your needs?",
      "model_response": "Thank you for reaching out and for thinking ahead about pregnancy prevention. I’ll share evidence-based information so you can decide whether Depo-Provera (the 3-monthly injectable, also called DMPA) fits your needs. If anything is unclear or you have additional concerns, you can always ask or speak with a trained health-care provider. The final choice is completely up to you.\n\n1. How Depo-Provera works  \n• A hormone called depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate is injected into the arm or buttock every 3 months (every 13 weeks—up to 15 weeks).  \n• It thickens cervical mucus and usually stops ovulation, preventing pregnancy.\n\n2. Effectiveness  \nTypical (average) use: about 4 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year (≈ 96 % effective).  \nPerfect use (no late injections): about 0.2 pregnancies per 100 users (≈ 99.8 % effective).  \nProtection starts:  \n – If injected within the first 7 days of a menstrual period: right away.  \n – If later: use condoms or abstain for 7 days.\n\n3. Medical eligibility for a 16-year-old (WHO MEC, 2022)  \nAge under 18 years = Category 2 (benefits generally outweigh any risks). The main concern is possible temporary loss of bone density, but no routine bone tests are required and the loss is usually regained after stopping. You can reduce the risk by:  \n• Eating calcium-rich foods (milk, green vegetables, beans, small fish with bones)  \n• Getting vitamin D from sunlight or fortified foods  \n• Doing regular weight-bearing exercise (walking, dancing).\n\nYou should not use Depo-Provera if you have certain conditions that fall under Category 3 or 4, such as unexplained vaginal bleeding, current breast cancer, severe liver disease, or within 3 weeks after a major blood clot. A provider will check your medical history to be sure.\n\n4. Possible advantages  \n• Highly effective and private—no one has to know once you receive the shot.  \n• Lasts 3 months: you don’t have to remember daily pills.  \n• Can reduce menstrual cramps and pain; many users eventually have very light or no monthly bleeding.  \n• Safe for breastfeeding, smokers, and most medical conditions.\n\n5. Possible disadvantages / side effects (usually not dangerous but can be bothersome)  \n• Irregular bleeding or spotting, especially in the first 6–12 months; later, periods may stop.  \n• Weight gain (average 1–2 kg per year for some users).  \n• Headaches, mood changes, or acne in a minority of users.  \n• Return to fertility is delayed: on average 9–10 months after the last injection (but could be up to 18 months).  \n• Very small, reversible reduction in bone density.\n\n6. Warning signs—seek care promptly if you notice:  \n• Very heavy or prolonged bleeding (soaking > 2 pads/hour for several hours)  \n• Severe lower abdominal pain  \n• Signs of pregnancy (rare)  \n• Severe headaches with blurred vision  \n• Yellow skin or eyes (possible liver problem)  \n• Swelling, warmth, or pain in one leg (possible clot).\n\n7. Visit schedule  \n• First injection: health-worker confirms you are not pregnant, checks medical history, and explains what to expect.  \n• Return every 3 months (no later than 15 weeks) for the next shot.  \n• If ever more than 15 weeks, you may need a pregnancy test or to wait for your next period.\n\n8. Other effective methods you might also consider (all are available to adolescents in Rwanda without parental consent and at low or no cost in public facilities):  \n• Implants (tiny rods in the arm, 3–5 years of protection, > 99 % effective; WHO MEC Category 1 for age under 18)  \n• Hormonal IUD (5 years) or copper IUD (10+ years)—both > 99 % effective.  \n• Combined pills, progestin-only pills, patch, ring (need daily/weekly/monthly action).  \n• Condoms (also prevent STIs) can be used alone or along with any other method for dual protection.  \n\n9. Confidentiality and cost in Rwanda  \n• By national policy you can obtain family planning without parental or partner consent.  \n• Services in public clinics are free or low-cost; you can ask about any fees in advance.  \n• Everything you share with the provider is confidential.\n\n10. Making your decision  \nAsk yourself:  \n• Is a 3-monthly clinic visit convenient for me?  \n• How would I feel if my periods change or stop?  \n• Do I want very rapid return to fertility when I stop, or is a possible delay acceptable?  \n• Would implants or IUDs be easier, or do I prefer an injectable?  \n• Do I also need condoms for STI protection?\n\nIf Depo-Provera sounds right for you after considering these points, you’re medically eligible (Category 2) and can start it at your next visit. If you’re unsure, you can discuss implants, IUDs, pills, or condoms with the provider—there is no wrong choice, only the one that best fits your life.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions now or later. Your health and autonomy are the priority.",

Because you have diabetes with vascular complications, it is important to look carefully at which contraceptive options are medically safe for you.\n\n1. Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs – the “traditional” birth-control pills that contain both estrogen and progestin)\n   • WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC): Diabetes + any vascular disease is Category 4 for COCs.  \n   • What Category 4 means: The risks outweigh the benefits; the method should not be used.  \n   • Reason: The estrogen component can increase the chance of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack, which is already higher in people with diabetic vascular complications.\n\n2. Progestin-only pills (POPs or “mini-pills”)\n   • WHO MEC: Diabetes + vascular disease is Category 3 for POPs.  \n   • What Category 3 means: Usually not recommended unless other, safer methods are not available or acceptable and a qualified clinician judges the benefits to outweigh the risks. Careful follow-up would be needed.  \n   • If you were to consider POPs, this decision should be made together with a clinician who can monitor your diabetes and vascular status closely.\n\n3. Other methods that are generally considered safer with diabetes and vascular disease\n   • Copper IUD (non-hormonal):\n       – WHO MEC: Category 1 (no restriction) for uncomplicated diabetes; Category 2 (advantages generally outweigh risks) when vascular complications are present.  \n       – Highly effective: typical-use pregnancy rate ≈ 0.8 per 100 women in the first year; perfect-use rate ≈ 0.6.  \n   • Male or female condoms: provide dual protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Typical-use pregnancy rate ≈ 13 (male) to 21 (female) per 100 women-years; perfect-use ≈ 2 and 5 respectively.  \n   • Permanent methods (male or female sterilization) if you are sure you do not want any (more) children. Failure rate < 1 pregnancy per 100 women in the first year.  \n   • Fertility-awareness or lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) may also be considered, but effectiveness is lower and depends on strict adherence to instructions.\n\n4. Methods that usually need careful specialist assessment or are not advised\n   • Injectable progestins (DMPA or NET-EN) and hormonal implants: WHO MEC Category 3 with diabetic vascular disease.  \n   • Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS): Category 3 with diabetic vascular disease.  \n   • Emergency contraception: a single dose of levonorgestrel EC pill is Category 1, so it can be used if needed.\n\n5.

Here is the information that the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Rwanda Ministry of Health give about copper-bearing intra-uterine devices (Cu-IUDs) for women living with HIV and taking antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\n1. Medical eligibility  \n• WHO Medical Eligibility Category (MEC) for Cu-IUD initiation in a woman who is HIV-positive, clinically well and on ART: Category 2  \n  “Advantages generally outweigh any theoretical or proven risks.”  \n• If you had AIDS and were not yet clinically stable or were having serious HIV-related illness, the category would be 3 (generally not recommended for a new insertion until your condition improves).  \n• Once the IUD is already in place, continuing to use it is Category 2 even for women with AIDS, unless you develop a complication such as pelvic infection.\n\n2. Effectiveness  \n• Typical (average) use: about 0.8 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (more than 99 % effective).  \n• Perfect use: about 0.6 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year.  \n• Works immediately after insertion and lasts at least 10–12 years depending on the model.\n\n3. Interaction with HIV and ART  \n• The copper IUD contains no hormones, so it does not interact with any antiretroviral medicines.  \n• It will not make your HIV worse, and HIV does not reduce the effectiveness of the IUD.\n\n4. What to expect and possible side-effects  \n• Heavier, longer or more painful periods, especially in the first few months.  \n• Light spotting between periods may occur at first.  \n• Cramping or discomfort for a short time after insertion.\n\n5. Warning signs: seek care urgently if you notice  \n(Use the memory aid “PAINS”)  \nP – Period late (or abnormal bleeding if you think you might be pregnant)  \nA – Abdominal or pelvic pain, especially with sexual intercourse  \nI – Infection signs: abnormal vaginal discharge, fever, chills  \nN – Not feeling well, fever or chills, or partner diagnosed with an STI  \nS – Strings missing, shorter, or longer than usual (IUD may have moved)\n\n6. Screening before insertion  \n• The provider will ask about recent high-risk sexual exposure, symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, and perform a pelvic exam to rule out current infection or pregnancy.  \n• Routine HIV viral-load testing or CD4 count is NOT required specifically for the IUD.\n\n7. Follow-up  \n• Return any time you have the warning signs above, or if you want the IUD removed, or if you cannot feel the strings.  \n• Otherwise, a routine check-up 3–6 weeks after insertion (or at the next ART review visit) and then as needed.\n\n8. Cost and access in Rwanda  \n• Public health centres provide Cu-IUD insertion and removal free or at low cost.  \n• No marital-status or parental-consent requirement; your HIV status does not limit access.\n\n9. Alternatives, if you decide against a copper IUD  \n• Progestogen-only injectable (DMPA), levonorgestrel implant, male or female condoms (which also protect against STIs), or combined hormonal methods—all are MEC Category 1 or 2 for women on ART, depending on the specific drug regimen.  \n• Dual protection (condoms + another highly effective method) is recommended for HIV prevention and contraception.\n\n10. Your choice  \nThe decision is yours. If you feel the Cu-IUD might suit you, the next step is to visit a trained provider who can confirm there is no current pelvic infection or pregnancy and insert the device. If you are unsure, you can ask for more details or discuss other methods—you do not have to decide immediately.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like more information about the insertion procedure, other contraceptive options, or anything else.",

Key counseling points for methods that remain suitable\n\nProgestin-only pills (POPs)  \n• Take one pill at the same time every day (3-hour window for most POPs).  \n• Common side effects: Irregular bleeding or spotting, occasional amenorrhea. Usually improve within a few months.  \n• Warning signs (rare): Severe abdominal pain, very heavy bleeding, positive pregnancy test—seek care.  \n\nInjectables (DMPA, every 3 months; NET-EN, every 2 months)  \n• Possible side effects: Irregular bleeding (especially first 6–12 months), weight change, delayed return to fertility (average 3–6 months after last injection).  \n• Warning signs: Very heavy bleeding, severe headaches with vision problems—seek care.  \n\nImplants (3–5 years)  \n• Inserted under the skin of the upper arm; fertility returns rapidly after removal.  \n• Side effects: Irregular bleeding or amenorrhea, mild bruising after insertion.  \n• Warning signs: Persistent arm pain, signs of infection at insertion site, very heavy bleeding.  \n\nIUDs (hormonal or copper; 3–12 years depending on type)  \n• Must be inserted by a trained provider.  \n• Copper IUD may cause heavier periods; LNG-IUD often reduces bleeding.  \n• Warning signs: PAINS mnemonic—Pregnancy signs, Abnormal bleeding, Infection (foul discharge, fever), Not feeling well, Strings missing/shorter/longer—seek care.  \n\n4. Effect on smoking or need to quit\nNone of the progestin-only or non-hormonal methods listed will interfere with efforts to stop smoking. Quitting smoking is strongly recommended for overall health, but you can start any of these contraceptive methods now regardless of your readiness to quit.\n\n5. Access in Rwanda\n• Under Rwanda’s National Family Planning Policy, all women—including unmarried women and adolescents—may obtain these methods without parental or partner consent.  \n• Services and commodities are free or low-cost at public health centers and through community health workers.  \n• You have the right to choose, switch, or discontinue any method at any time.\n\n6. Next steps\n• If you would like to explore progestin-only pills, injectables, an implant, or an IUD, a trained provider can review your medical history in detail, perform any necessary examinations, and start the method you prefer—often on the same day if you are reasonably sure you are not pregnant.  \n• If you have any new symptoms such as chest pain, severe headache, or very heavy vaginal bleeding, please seek medical care right away.  \n\nI hope this helps you make an informed choice. Would you like more details on any of these methods, or assistance preparing for a clinic visit?",

      "ground_truth": "No, the birth control patch (and all methods containing estrogen - pills, ring, injection) are not safe for you because of your history of blood clots. Having had a DVT significantly increases your risk of developing another clot, and estrogen-containing contraceptives would increase that risk even more. Safe and effective alternatives include progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, the hormonal IUD (which has only local hormones), or the copper IUD. All of these are highly effective and won't increase your blood clot risk.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing this important information about your health history.  \nBelow is evidence-based guidance drawn directly from the 2022 WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) and the WHO Family Planning Handbook, presented in a non-directive way so you can make the choice that feels right for you.\n\n1. Medical eligibility for the birth-control patch  \n   • The patch is a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) that contains both estrogen and progestin.  \n   • WHO MEC classification for someone with a past deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (VTE) is:  \n     – Category 3 (risks usually outweigh benefits) if the clot occurred more than 3 months ago and you have no continuing risk factors.  \n     – Category 4 (unacceptable health risk) if any additional risk factor for another clot is present (for example thrombophilia, prolonged immobility, major surgery, obesity, smoking, etc.).  \n   Since you had a DVT 5 years ago, the patch would fall into MEC Category 3 at best. WHO advises avoiding CHCs—including the patch—when Category 3 or 4 conditions exist, because estrogen markedly increases the chance of another clot.  \n\n   Bottom line: The patch is generally NOT recommended for you. A safer method that does not contain estrogen would be advised.\n\n2. What the patch would have offered (for comparison only)  \n   • Typical-use effectiveness: about 93 % (7 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year)  \n   • Perfect-use effectiveness: >99 % (≤1 pregnancy per 100 users in the first year)  \n   • Main side effects: irregular bleeding, breast tenderness, skin irritation at the patch site, possible weight change.  \n   • Serious warning signs (for people who can use it): severe leg pain or swelling, chest pain, sudden shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes—seek care immediately.\n\n3. Safer alternatives you can consider (all are MEC Category 1—safe—or Category 2 for someone with a past DVT):  \n   • Copper IUD (non-hormonal) – 99 % effective, works for 10–12 years.  \n   • Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) – 99 % effective, works 5–8 years, can lighten periods.  \n   • Progestin-only implant (e.g., levonorgestrel or etonogestrel) – 99 % effective, 3–5 years.  \n   • Progestin-only injectables (DMPA every 3 months or NET-EN every 2 months) – 96 % typical use.  \n   • Progestin-only pills (POP/minipill) – 93 % typical use; must be taken at the same time daily.  \n   • Male or female condoms – 87 % typical use; also protect against STIs including HIV.  \n   • Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) if you gave birth less than 6 months ago, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, and have no menses.  \n   • Permanent methods (female or male sterilization) if you are certain you do not want any future pregnancies.\n\n4. How to decide  \n   • Think about effectiveness, how often you need to remember the method, side effects, return to fertility, and whether you want hormones or non-hormonal.  \n   • You are welcome to bring a partner or trusted friend, but it is entirely your decision.  \n   • In Rwanda, family-planning services are free or low-cost in public facilities, and adolescents or unmarried women have the same right to care without needing parental or partner consent.\n\n5. Next steps and when to seek care  \n   • Schedule a visit with a qualified health-care provider to review your clot history in detail and choose a method that is Category 1 or 2 for you.  \n   • Seek immediate medical attention if you ever experience new leg swelling, sudden chest pain, or trouble breathing, whether or not you are using contraception.\n\nIf anything is unclear or you need more information about a specific method, please let me know. I’m here to support you in making the choice that is safest and most convenient for your life.",

Important additional benefits  \n   • The only contraceptive method that also provides dual protection against HIV and most other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  \n   • Readily available without a prescription in Rwanda; free or very low-cost in public facilities and many community-based distribution points.  \n   • No medical conditions in which condoms are restricted (WHO MEC category 1 for all users).\n\n3. How to use correctly (male condom example)  \n   • Use a new condom with every act of vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  \n   • Put the condom on the erect penis before any genital contact.  \n   • Pinch the tip to leave space for semen, then unroll to the base.  \n   • After ejaculation, hold the rim and withdraw while still erect, then dispose of it safely.  \n   • Store condoms in a cool, dry place—avoid heat or sharp objects.\n\n4. Possible side effects / concerns  \n   • Temporary loss of sensation or interruption of sexual flow for some users.  \n   • Rare latex allergy or irritation; polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms are an option if latex sensitive.  \n   • Some people notice vaginal dryness; water-based lubricants can help. Oil-based products (petroleum jelly, body oil) weaken latex condoms.\n\n5. Warning signs and when to seek care  \n   • Persistent itching, rash, swelling, shortness of breath, or hives after condom use—could signal latex allergy.  \n   • Any sign of STI (unusual discharge, sores, pain). Visit a health facility for assessment and treatment.  \n   • If a condom breaks, slips, or is forgotten, emergency contraception can be taken within 120 hours; seek a provider promptly.\n\n6. Tips to improve effectiveness  \n   • Practice putting condoms on outside the sexual situation.  \n   • Keep a supply at hand so you are not caught unprepared.  \n   • Combine with another method (e.g., condoms + hormonal contraception) for even higher pregnancy protection and continued STI prevention (“dual method use”).\n\n7. Autonomy and confidentiality in Rwanda  \n   • Anyone, including adolescents and unmarried people, can obtain condoms without parental or partner consent.  \n   • Services are confidential and should be non-judgmental.  \n   • If cost is a concern, ask at public health centers or community health workers for free supplies.\n\nIf you need more help choosing or using condoms, or experience any of the warning signs above, please visit a qualified healthcare provider or a nearby family-planning clinic.",

For higher effectiveness, the copper IUD can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sex and is more than 99% effective as emergency contraception.",
      "model_response": "Here is a concise, evidence-based overview drawn from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+).\n\n1. What is “emergency contraception” (EC)?\n   • A method used AFTER unprotected sex, contraceptive failure (e.g., broken condom), or sexual assault to prevent pregnancy.  \n   • Does not disrupt an established pregnancy and is not the same as medical abortion.\n\n2. Available EC options and how well they work\n\nA. Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD) inserted within 5 days of the earliest possible ovulation*\n   • Effectiveness: >99% (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 users).  \n   • Remains highly effective for at least 10–12 years if left in place as ongoing contraception.  \n   • MEC category: 1 for most women; check MEC tables for exceptions (e.g., current pelvic infection = MEC 4).\n\nB. Levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (LNG-ECPs) 1.5 mg single dose, or 0.75 mg × 2 doses 12 h apart\n   • Effectiveness: If 1000 women take it within 72 h, about 14 will become pregnant (≈86–88 % effective).  \n     ‑ Highest protection (≈95–99 %) when taken within the first 24 h.  \n     ‑ Some protection up to 120 h (5 days), but efficacy declines each day.  \n   • MEC category: 1 for all women, including adolescents and breastfeeding women.\n\nC. Ulipristal acetate (UPA-ECP) 30 mg single dose\n   • Effectiveness: About 98–99 % when used within 120 h; maintains consistent effectiveness across the 5-day window.  \n   • Not recommended during breastfeeding for the first 7 days after use (WHO: “caution”). MEC 2 for breastfeeding <6 weeks, MEC 1 thereafter.\n\nD. Yuzpe combined estrogen-progestin regimen (older method; e.g., 100 µg ethinylestradiol + 1.0 mg LNG, 2 doses 12 h apart)\n   • Effectiveness: Roughly 57–75 % (more pregnancies compared with dedicated ECPs).  \n   • Causes more nausea/vomiting. Generally considered a back-up when dedicated ECPs are unavailable.\n\n*If the date of ovulation is uncertain, a Cu-IUD can be inserted up to 5 days after the last act of unprotected intercourse.\n\n3. Key counseling points (non-directive)\n   • The sooner EC is used, the better it works.  \n   • EC does NOT protect against pregnancy from sex that happens later in the same cycle—start or resume a regular contraceptive method right away.  \n   • EC does NOT protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs); offer condoms and STI screening when appropriate.  \n   • Repeat use of ECPs is safe but less effective and more expensive than having a regular, ongoing contraceptive method.  \n   • In Rwanda, adolescents and unmarried women have the right to obtain EC without parental or partner consent, free or at low cost in public facilities.\n\n4. Possible side-effects and warning signs\n\nA. Emergency contraceptive pills\n   • Short-term: mild nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, headache, slight bleeding or change in next menses.  \n   • Menses usually comes on time or within ±7 days. If >4 weeks late, do a pregnancy test.  \n   • No evidence of long-term fertility problems or harm to an existing pregnancy.  \n   • Seek care if: severe abdominal pain (could indicate ectopic pregnancy, although rare).\n\nB. Copper IUD\n   • During insertion: cramping, dizziness.  \n   • After insertion: heavier or more painful periods for some users, especially in the first 3–6 months.  \n   • Warning signs (PAINS): Period late (pregnancy), Abdominal pain, Infection exposure, Not feeling well (fever/chills), Strings missing/shorter/longer—seek care promptly.\n\n5. When to follow up\n   • No mandatory follow-up after ECPs unless there is heavy bleeding, severe pain, or menstrual delay >4 weeks.  \n   • For Cu-IUD: routine check-up in 4–6 weeks or sooner if any warning signs.\n\n6. Summary effectiveness chart (failure rates)\n\nMethod (one-time use)     | Pregnancies per 100 users\nCopper IUD                 | <1\nUPA-ECP 30 mg              | ~1–2\nLNG-ECP ≤72 h              | ~14\nYuzpe regimen              | ~25–45\n\nRemember, you are free to choose whichever method best suits your needs and circumstances.

If you have any significant health conditions, a trained provider will assess you against the WHO MEC before insertion.\n\nAdvantages  \n• Very high effectiveness.  \n• Long-acting and quickly reversible.  \n• No routine resupply visits; only periodic check-ups as advised.  \n• Can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sex as the most effective form of emergency contraception.  \n• Safe during breast-feeding; no effect on milk.  \n• Cost-effective: in Rwanda, insertion and follow-up are free or low-cost at public facilities.\n\nPossible side-effects / changes  \n• Heavier, longer, or more painful periods, especially in the first 3–6 months.  \n• More cramps during menstruation.  \n• Light spotting between periods in the first months.  \nThese changes usually lessen with time.  If they are unmanageable, you can have the IUD removed.\n\nRare but serious complications  \n• Uterine perforation (≈1/1 000 insertions, usually recognized and managed at insertion).  \n• Expulsion (IUD may partly or completely come out; risk ≈2–10 % in first year).  \n• Pelvic infection is slightly increased only during the first 20 days after insertion.\n\nWarning signs—seek care promptly if you notice:  \nP A I N S mnemonic  \n• P – Period late, very heavy bleeding, or bleeding after sex  \n• A – Abdominal or pelvic pain, cramps, or pain with intercourse  \n• I – Infection signs (fever, chills, foul-smelling vaginal discharge)  \n• N – Not feeling well, severe tiredness, or weakness  \n• S – Strings missing, shorter, or longer than before, or you feel the hard plastic of the IUD in the cervix\n\nAutonomy and follow-up  \n• You have the right to decide whether to use an IUD, another method, or no method.  \n• If you ever wish to become pregnant or no longer want the device, you can have it removed at any time; fertility returns quickly.  \n• A check-up 3–6 weeks after insertion (or sooner if any concerns) is recommended but not mandatory if you have no problems.  \n\nIf you are interested, the next steps would be:  \n1. Screening with a trained provider to be sure the method is safe for you (following WHO MEC).  \n2. Insertion by a qualified clinician or well-trained nurse.  \n3. Counseling on what to expect and how to check the strings.  \n\nIf you have additional questions or specific health concerns, feel free to discuss them with a healthcare provider.",

Effectiveness  \n• Typical (real-life) use: about 93 % effective → roughly 7 pregnancies per 100 women during the first year of use.  \n• Perfect (correct and consistent) use: > 99 % effective → about 3 pregnancies per 1,000 women during the first year.  \nEffectiveness is the same for adolescents and adults.\n\n3. How to use it correctly  \n• Start any time you are reasonably sure you are not pregnant (use back-up condoms for the first 7 days if you start after day 5 of your period).  \n• Apply the patch to clean, dry skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm, or upper back.  \n• Change to a new patch on the same day each week for three weeks.  \n• Week 4: no patch. Then start a new cycle.\n\n4. Common side-effects (usually mild and improve after the first few cycles)  \n• Irregular spotting or bleeding between periods  \n• Breast tenderness  \n• Nausea or mild headaches  \n• Skin irritation at the patch site  \n• Mood changes or slight weight change\n\n5. Warning signs—seek care immediately if you notice (ACHES)  \n• A – severe Abdominal pain  \n• C – Chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing blood  \n• H – severe Headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness  \n• E – Eye problems: sudden blurred or loss of vision  \n• S – Severe leg pain or swelling (calf or thigh)  \nAlso seek care for yellow skin/eyes, very high blood pressure readings, or persistent severe headaches.\n\n6. Medical eligibility (WHO MEC)  \nMost healthy women can use the patch (Category 1).  \nIt is NOT recommended (Category 3 or 4) if you have:  \n• Less than 6 weeks postpartum and breastfeeding (C4)  \n• Smoker aged ≥ 35 years who smokes ≥ 15 cigarettes/day (C4)  \n• Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, current deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, stroke, ischemic heart disease, severe hypertension (≥ 160/100 mmHg), migraine with aura, certain liver diseases, breast cancer, or major surgery with prolonged immobilization.  \nIf you have any of these, discuss alternative methods with a healthcare provider.\n\n7. Advantages  \n• Highly effective when used correctly  \n• Only weekly action—no daily pill to remember  \n• Rapid return to fertility after stopping  \n• Non-interfering with sex\n\n8. Possible disadvantages  \n• Requires remembering the change day each week  \n• May be less effective in women weighing ≥ 90 kg (200 lb) – evidence is mixed; discuss with a provider  \n• Requires access to resupply every month  \n• Visible on the skin (some clients mind, some don’t)\n\n9. When to return or seek help  \n• If the patch comes off for > 24 hours—re-apply a new patch and use condoms for 7 days  \n• If you experience any warning signs listed above  \n• If you have heavy or prolonged bleeding, or any severe side effect you cannot tolerate  \n• For routine follow-up or if you want to switch to another method\n\n10. Access in Rwanda  \n• Available at most public and many private facilities; services are free or low-cost in public clinics.  \n• All clients, including adolescents and unmarried women, may obtain the patch without needing parental or partner consent.  \n• If cost or availability is a concern, ask at the nearest health centre or call 114 (RBC hotline).\n\nRemember: You are free to choose, start, switch, or stop any family-planning method at any time. If you have any medical conditions or are unsure whether the patch is right for you, please talk with a qualified healthcare provider for personalized advice.",

You might also consider:\n• Expected bleeding changes (the hormonal IUD usually lightens—or may stop—menstrual bleeding, while the copper IUD can cause heavier or longer bleeding for some people, especially in the first months).  \n• Hormonal vs. non-hormonal preference.  \n• Duration of protection (hormonal IUD 3–8 years depending on brand; copper IUD up to 12 years).  \n• Medical conditions (most users are MEC 1 or 2 for either IUD, but a provider will screen for any category 3 or 4 conditions).  \n• Availability and cost: in Rwanda, both methods are offered free or at low cost in public facilities.\n\nIf you’d like to explore which option fits your needs, a trained provider can review your health history, explain insertion and removal, discuss possible side-effects and warning signs, and answer any other questions you may have.",

      "model_response": "Here is the information you asked for, using the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS +). I have also added a few Rwanda-specific service details.\n\nEffectiveness  \n• Typical (average) use: about 94 % effective — roughly 6 pregnancies per 100 women during the first year of use.  \n• Perfect (correct and on-time) use: more than 99 % effective — fewer than 1 pregnancy (≈0.2–0.3) per 100 women in the first year.  \nKey point: one injection of Depo-Provera (DMPA 150 mg IM) is required every 13 weeks (3 months). Missing or delaying an injection lowers effectiveness.\n\nHow it works  \nA synthetic progestin keeps the ovaries from releasing an egg, thickens cervical mucus, and thins the uterine lining.\n\nCommon side-effects (usually not harmful and often lessen after the first few injections)  \n• Irregular bleeding or spotting, especially in the first 3–6 months  \n• No monthly bleeding (amenorrhea) after several injections — this is common and not harmful  \n• Possible weight gain (average 1–2 kg per year)  \n• Headaches, breast tenderness, mood changes or acne in some users  \n• Delayed return to fertility: on average 9–10 months from the last injection before ovulation resumes (can be shorter or longer)\n\nRare but important warning signs — seek care promptly if you have:  \n• Very heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking more than 2 pads per hour for 2 successive hours)  \n• Severe lower abdominal pain  \n• Severe headache with vision changes or migraine with aura (new onset)  \n• Jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)  \n• Signs of pregnancy or any suspicion of pregnancy  \n• Signs of infection at the injection site (increasing redness, swelling, pain, fever)\n\nMedical eligibility (WHO MEC)  \n• Category 1 (safe for use) for most women.  \n• Category 3 or 4 for certain conditions (for example, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer, severe high blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg, certain lupus types). If you have any chronic illness, medicines, or are breastfeeding a baby <6 weeks, discuss with a trained provider.\n\nProtection against STIs/HIV  \n• Depo-Provera does NOT protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Use condoms if STI/HIV protection is also needed.  \n• Current WHO guidance: women at substantial risk of HIV can continue to use progestin-only injectables but should be advised on, and have access to, HIV prevention options (condoms, PrEP, etc.).\n\nWhen to start  \n• Any time it is reasonably certain you are not pregnant (MEC guidance).  \n• Postpartum:  \n  – Breastfeeding ≥6 weeks: Category 1  \n  – Breastfeeding <6 weeks: Category 3 (delay)  \n  – Not breastfeeding: can start at or after day 21 postpartum  \n• Post-abortion: can start immediately.\n\nWhen to return  \n• Every 13 weeks for the next injection (you can come up to 2 weeks early and up to 4 weeks late without needing additional contraception).  \n• Come sooner if you have side effects you find bothersome or any warning signs.\n\nDiscontinuation/return to fertility  \n• You may stop at any time.  \n• Fertility may take several months to return; this is normal and does not mean infertility.\n\nCost and availability in Rwanda  \n• Depo-Provera is offered free or at low cost in public health facilities and through community health workers.  \n• Adolescents and unmarried women can obtain it without parental or spousal consent.  \n• If cost or distance is a concern, ask about community-based distributors who can give the injection nearer your home.\n\nSupport for your decision  \n• It is your choice whether Depo-Provera fits your needs, lifestyle, and health situation.  \n• If you are not sure, you may want to compare it with other options (e.g., implants, pills, IUD, condoms). A counselor can help you weigh advantages and disadvantages without pressure.\n\nIf you need any clarification or wish to explore other methods, please let me know.",

      "model_response": "Effectiveness  \n• Typical-use effectiveness: about 78 %. This means roughly 22 out of every 100 women whose partners rely on withdrawal for one year will become pregnant.  \n• Correct (perfect) use: about 96 % effective—approximately 4 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year when the man always withdraws before any semen is released.  \n(Estimates from WHO Family Planning Handbook, 2022.)\n\nHow the method works  \nThe man removes his penis from the vagina before ejaculation so semen is released away from the woman’s external genitalia.\n\nKey points clients often consider  \nAdvantages  \n• Immediately available; no supplies or clinic visit needed  \n• No direct cost  \n• No hormonal side-effects  \n• Can be used by couples who have religious or cultural reasons for avoiding other methods  \n• May be a temporary choice while deciding on another method\n\nLimitations / challenges  \n• Requires high self-control and good communication between partners every time you have sex  \n• Pre-ejaculatory fluid can contain some sperm; pregnancy can still occur even with correct use  \n• No protection against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  \n• Failure rates are considerably higher than with most modern contraceptive methods\n\nCorrect use tips  \n1. The man must withdraw his penis before ejaculation every single act of vaginal sex.  \n2. Ejaculation should occur well away from the woman’s genitals—ideally on a cloth or tissue and not on the vulva or thighs.  \n3. The man should urinate and wipe the tip of the penis before the next act of vaginal sex, because residual sperm may still be present.  \n4. Good communication is essential: both partners need to be comfortable reminding each other if withdrawal is delayed.  \n5. Have emergency contraception on hand in case there is concern that semen touched the vagina or the timing was late (EC pills are most effective within 72 hours but can be used up to 120 hours).\n\nPossible “side-effects” and health concerns  \n• None from a medical standpoint. Some couples experience reduced sexual satisfaction or anxiety about timing.\n\nWarning signs / when to seek care  \nThere are no medical danger signs specific to withdrawal itself. However, seek professional care if:  \n• You think you might be pregnant and do not want to be, or you want to confirm a pregnancy.  \n• You or your partner may have been exposed to HIV or another STI—consider HIV testing, condoms, or post-exposure prophylaxis.  \n• You find withdrawal difficult to practice consistently and wish to explore more effective methods.\n\nComparing with other methods  \nMost hormonal and long-acting reversible methods (implants, IUDs, injectables, pills) and condoms (with perfect use) are more effective at preventing pregnancy. In Rwanda, these methods are available free or at low cost in public facilities, and adolescents can access them without parental consent.\n\nInformed-choice reminders  \n• If withdrawal feels right for now, it is acceptable to use it.  \n• You are free to change methods at any time, alone or together with your partner.  \n• Combining withdrawal with condom use provides better pregnancy prevention and protection from STIs.  \n• If pregnancy prevention is very important to you, consider adding or switching to a more effective, reversible method.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like information on other contraceptive options, how to obtain them locally, or how to use emergency contraception.",

      "model_response": "Below is a concise, evidence-based answer drawn from the WHO Family Planning Global Handbook (2022 update), the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+), and—where relevant—the Rwanda National Family Planning Policy (2021).\n\n────────────────────────\n1. How effective are fertility-awareness methods (FAM)?\n────────────────────────\nEffectiveness depends on the specific method and how consistently and correctly it is used.\n\nA. Typical-use effectiveness (what happens in real life, including mistakes)\n• About 76 %–88 % effective  \n  – This means 12–24 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of use.\n\nB. Perfect-use effectiveness (when every rule is followed correctly, every day)\n• About 95 %–98 % effective  \n  – As few as 1–5 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year, depending on the method.\n\nTypical WHO figures for individual methods\n• Standard Days Method® (for cycles 26–32 days): 88 % typical, 95 % perfect  \n• TwoDay Method® (cervical mucus): 86 % typical, 96 % perfect  \n• Symptothermal Method (mucus + temperature + cycle days): ≈75 % typical, ≥98 % perfect  \n• Calendar (rhythm) alone: ≈76 % typical, ≈91 % perfect  \n• Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM, 0–6 months postpartum, exclusive BF): 98 % perfect if all criteria met\n\n────────────────────────\n2. Key points about fertility-awareness methods\n────────────────────────\n1. No hormones or devices: therefore no medical side-effects.  \n2. Require daily attention and partner cooperation (abstinence or condoms during fertile days).  \n3. Work best for women/couples who can:\n   • Track cycles or bodily signs accurately\n   • Keep written or app records\n   • Avoid unprotected sex during fertile days\n4. Protection against STIs/HIV: NONE. A condom is needed for that.\n\n────────────────────────\n3. Who can use them?  (WHO MEC)\n────────────────────────\n• WHO classifies almost all medical conditions as Category 1 (no restrictions) for FAM, because they do not involve medicines or procedures.  \n• HOWEVER, some situations make the method less reliable, not unsafe. Examples (WHO wording: “b” = method may be difficult to use correctly):\n  – Irregular or very long/short cycles (including adolescents <3 yrs after menarche)  \n  – Recent use of hormonal contraception (may disturb cycle signs temporarily)  \n  – Post-partum before regular menses return (other than LAM)  \n  – Perimenopause  \n  – Vaginal infections affecting mucus observation  \n• If any of these apply, a second method (e.g. condoms) or another option may be advisable.\n\n────────────────────────\n4. Advantages clients often mention\n────────────────────────\n• Natural, hormone-free, device-free  \n• Helps learn about one’s body and fertility  \n• Can be used to achieve or avoid pregnancy  \n• Culturally or religiously acceptable for many couples  \n• Available at no or very low cost in Rwanda’s public facilities\n\n────────────────────────\n5. Challenges and possible disadvantages\n────────────────────────\n• Requires daily commitment and partner support  \n• No sex, or condom use, during the fertile days (8–15 days per cycle depending on method)  \n• Lower protection with typical use compared to long-acting reversible or permanent methods  \n• No protection from STIs/HIV\n\n────────────────────────\n6. Possible side-effects\n────────────────────────\n• None known. Some users feel stress about counting days or negotiating condom use, but no physical side-effects occur.\n\n────────────────────────\n7. Warning signs and when to seek help\n────────────────────────\nBecause FAM are non-medical, there are no physical warning signs. Seek help from a trained provider if:\n• Your cycles suddenly become highly irregular  \n• You have difficulty interpreting mucus or temperature signs  \n• You think you might be pregnant  \n• You need condoms or another back-up method  \n• You experience intimate-partner violence when negotiating abstinence or condom use\n\n────────────────────────\n8. Tips for correct, consistent use\n────────────────────────\n• Receive face-to-face instruction from a trained provider or counselor.  \n• Keep a dedicated calendar, chart, or reliable mobile app approved for that specific FAM.  \n• Mark your fertile window each cycle as instructed.  \n• Use condoms or abstain during every fertile day—no exceptions.  \n• Have a back-up plan for travel, illness, alcohol, or other situations that could disrupt charting.  \n• Re-assess your satisfaction every few cycles; switch whenever your needs change.\n\n────────────────────────\n9. Your right to choose\n────────────────────────\n• In Rwanda, adolescents and adults alike may choose any contraceptive method—including FAM—without parental or spousal consent.  \n• All public facilities must provide counseling free or at minimal cost.  \n• If at any point you prefer another method, you are free to switch.\n\n────────────────────────\n10. Next steps\n────────────────────────\n• If you feel FAM might suit you, schedule a counseling session with a trained provider to learn and practice the specific method that best matches your lifestyle (e.g. Standard Days, TwoDay, Symptothermal).  \n• If you need protection from STIs, plan dual protection (condoms + FAM).  \n• Keep follow-up appointments or phone check-ins, especially for the first 3–6 cycles.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed choice. Let me know if you would like information on other methods or support resources.",

      "model_response": "Effectiveness of the diaphragm (used with spermicide), according to the WHO Family Planning Global Handbook (2022):\n\nTypical use  \n• Around 12–18 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of use.  \n• This means it is about 82–88 % effective in typical, everyday conditions—when some users may not insert it correctly or may forget to use spermicide every time.\n\nCorrect (perfect) use  \n• About 6 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year.  \n• In other words, up to 94 % effective when it is inserted properly every time, used with fresh spermicide, left in place for at least 6 hours after intercourse, and not left in longer than 24 hours.\n\nKey points that influence effectiveness  \n• The diaphragm must be used every time you have sex.  \n• You need additional spermicide every time you have intercourse or if intercourse is repeated while the diaphragm is still in place.  \n• Good placement technique and correct size (fitted by a trained provider) improve protection.\n\nRemember  \n• No method apart from permanent contraception and, to a degree, implants/IUDs is 100 % effective.  \n• If you want a method with higher “everyday” (typical-use) effectiveness, you might consider long-acting reversible contraceptives such as implants or IUDs, which have failure rates of <1 % per year with both typical and perfect use.  \n• You are free to choose whatever method best fits your needs and lifestyle; if you’d like more details or a hands-on fitting, visit a trained provider. Public facilities in Rwanda offer family-planning services free or at very low cost.",

      "ground_truth": "Tubal ligation (getting your tubes tied) is more than 99% effective and is considered permanent. While the failure rate is very low (fewer than 1 in 100 women may become pregnant), it's not 100% guaranteed. Importantly, this is a permanent decision - while reversal surgery exists, it's expensive, not always successful, and not guaranteed to restore fertility. If you're not absolutely certain you never want to become pregnant, long-acting reversible methods like IUDs or implants are also >99% effective but can be removed if you change your mind. Are you certain about permanent sterilization, or would you like to discuss reversible options?",
      "model_response": "Thank you for your question. I will share evidence-based information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Rwanda’s national guidelines so that you can decide what is best for you.\n\n1. Can pregnancy still happen after tubal ligation (female sterilization)?\n• Tubal ligation is one of the most effective contraceptive methods available.  \n• Effectiveness:  \n  – Typical-use pregnancy rate: about 0.5 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (99.5 % effective).  \n  – Perfect-use pregnancy rate: about 0.2 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (99.8 % effective).  \n• Lifetime risk: Because the method is intended to be permanent, failures are uncommon but can occur—about 1–2 pregnancies per 1,000 procedures over the first year and about 2–10 per 1,000 over 10 years.  \n• If a pregnancy does occur, there is a higher chance that it could be ectopic (outside the uterus), which is a medical emergency.\n\n2. Why pregnancy can still rarely happen\n• The fallopian tubes may not be completely blocked or could reconnect over time.  \n• Surgical error is uncommon but possible.  \n• No method, except abstinence, is 100 % effective.\n\n3. What to watch for after the procedure (warning signs)\nSeek care immediately if you experience:  \n• Severe or increasing abdominal pain, fever, or heavy bleeding in the days after surgery.  \n• Late or missed menstrual period combined with abdominal pain or unusual bleeding months or years later—this could signal an ectopic pregnancy.  \n• Signs of infection at the incision site (redness, swelling, pus).\n\n4. Side effects and recovery\n• Mild abdominal discomfort, fatigue, or shoulder pain from the gas used during laparoscopy (if that technique is used) usually resolves in a few days.  \n• Light vaginal bleeding for a day or two is normal.  \n• No effect on hormones, sexual desire, breastfeeding, or menstruation.\n\n5. Important considerations\n• Permanence: Reversal surgery is costly, not always available, and does not guarantee pregnancy, so the procedure should be chosen only if you are sure you do not want more (or any) children.  \n• Timing: Can be done postpartum, post-abortion, or at any time if pregnancy is reasonably ruled out.  \n• WHO Medical Eligibility: Category 1 for most healthy women (no restrictions). Certain medical conditions may shift the risk–benefit balance; a provider will screen for these.\n\n6. Access in Rwanda\n• According to the Rwanda National Family Planning Policy (2021), female sterilization is offered in public facilities at no cost or low cost.  \n• All women, including adolescents and unmarried women, are eligible and do not need spousal or parental consent.  \n• You may be referred to a higher-level facility if the service is not available in your nearest health center.\n\n7. If you are unsure\n• You can consider long-acting reversible methods (implants, IUDs) that are almost as effective and can be removed if you change your mind.\n\n8. Next steps\n• If you proceed, make sure you receive:  \n  – Pre-operative counseling and informed consent.  \n  – Post-operative instructions, including when you can resume normal activities (usually within a week).  \n• If you think you might be pregnant at any point after sterilization, take a pregnancy test and see a provider immediately.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions or would like to discuss alternative methods.",

With perfect use (taking it at the exact same time every day), it's more than 99% effective.

      "model_response": "Effectiveness of the Progestin-Only Pill (POP, “mini-pill”)\n\n• Typical-use effectiveness: About 93 % (≈ 7 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of use).  \n• Perfect-use effectiveness: About 99 % (≈ 0.3 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year when taken exactly as directed, every day at the same time).  \n(WHO Family Planning: A Global Handbook 2022; effectiveness table, combined oral and progestin-only pills.)\n\nPoints to keep in mind\n\n1. How it works  \n   • Contains only a progestin hormone.  \n   • Prevents pregnancy mainly by thickening cervical mucus and, in some users, by suppressing ovulation.\n\n2. Key to maintaining high effectiveness  \n   • Take one pill every day, at the same hour.  \n   • A delay of more than 3 hours (for most POPs) or 12 hours (for the drospirenone 24/4 POP) counts as a “missed pill” and can reduce protection; follow the missed-pill instructions or consult a provider.\n\n3. Common, usually mild side-effects (often improve after the first few cycles)  \n   • Irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting  \n   • Lighter, less painful periods—or no bleeding at all  \n   • Headache, breast tenderness, or mood changes in some users\n\n4. Warning signs—seek care promptly if you notice:  \n   • Severe lower-abdominal pain (possible ectopic pregnancy or ovarian cyst)  \n   • Heavy or prolonged bleeding that soaks >2 pads per hour for 2 consecutive hours  \n   • Signs of severe headache with neurologic changes, jaundice, or suspicion of pregnancy\n\n5. Medical eligibility (WHO MEC)  \n   • Most women, including breastfeeding women 6 weeks postpartum or more, adolescents, and women who cannot use estrogen, can safely use POPs (MEC Category 1 or 2 for the vast majority of conditions).  \n   • Certain conditions (e.g., current breast cancer = Category 4; severe liver disease = Category 3/4) require alternative methods or specialist review.\n\n6. Access in Rwanda  \n   • Available free or at very low cost in public health facilities and many community-based distribution sites.  \n   • Adolescents and unmarried women can obtain POPs without parental or partner consent.  \n   • If privacy is a concern, ask for youth-friendly services or community health workers trained in family planning.\n\n7. When to start  \n   • Any time it is reasonably certain you are not pregnant.  \n   • Immediate protection if you start within the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle; otherwise use condoms or abstain for the first 48 hours.\n\n8. Dual protection  \n   • POPs do not protect against HIV or other STIs. Use condoms as well if you may be at risk.\n\nYour choice is yours—feel free to compare this method with others. If you have further questions or any medical condition you are unsure about, a qualified health-care provider or trained community health worker can help you make the decision that best fits your life and health.",

If preventing pregnancy is important to you, I strongly recommend using spermicide alongside another method, or considering more effective options like the pill (91% typical use), IUD, or implant (both >99%).",
      "model_response": "Effectiveness\n\n• Typical-use effectiveness: about 79 % (approximately 21 pregnancies per 100 women during the first year of use).  \n• Correct and consistent (perfect) use every time you have sex: about 85 % (15 – 18 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).\n\nWhat this means: spermicide used alone prevents some pregnancies, but it is noticeably less reliable than most other modern methods. Many people choose to combine it with condoms or another barrier to improve protection.\n\nHow spermicide works\n• The most common active ingredient is nonoxynol-9, a chemical that inactivates sperm.  \n• It comes as a gel, foam, film, tablet, or suppository that is placed deep in the vagina before every act of intercourse.  \n• Most products need 10–15 minutes to melt/foam and are effective for about 1 hour. A fresh dose is needed for each act of sex, even if it is within the same hour.\n\nWHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC)\n• Category 1 (no restriction) for most women.  \n• Category 4 (unacceptable health risk) for women at high risk of HIV acquisition, because frequent use of nonoxynol-9 can irritate vaginal tissue and may increase HIV risk.  \n• Category 2 for women living with HIV who are clinically well and on ART.  \nIf you are unsure about your HIV risk, talk with a health-care provider first.\n\nAdvantages\n• Can be bought without a prescription in many countries.  \n• Used only when needed; no daily routine.  \n• Gives immediate control to the person who inserts it.  \n• No effect on breastfeeding.  \n• Few systemic (whole-body) side-effects.\n\nPossible side-effects\n• Mild vaginal or penile irritation or burning (usually short-lived).  \n• Allergy (rare). Stop using and seek care if you develop rash or swelling.  \n• Frequent use (more than twice a day) may increase risk of genital lesions or HIV acquisition.\n\nWarning signs – seek care if you notice:\n• Persistent burning, itching, unusual discharge, sores, or rash in the genital area.  \n• Signs of allergy (swelling of lips, tongue, or face; difficulty breathing).  \n• You think you might be pregnant and do not wish to be.\n\nInstructions for correct use\n1. Wash hands.  \n2. Check the expiry date.  \n3. Insert the full dose high into the vagina, close to the cervix.  \n4. Wait the time specified on the package (usually 10–15 minutes).  \n5. Have sex within the product’s effective window (usually ≤1 hour).  \n6. Insert a new dose for every act of intercourse.  \n7. Do not douche or wash the vagina for at least 6 hours afterward.  \n8. For greater protection, consider using a male or female condom as well (dual protection against both pregnancy and STIs, including HIV).\n\nAccess in Rwanda\n• Spermicides are less commonly stocked in public clinics than other methods, but some pharmacies may carry them.  \n• Family-planning services at public facilities are free or low-cost; staff can tell you where to find spermicidal products if you choose them.  \n• Adolescents and all women, married or not, have the right to obtain family-planning methods without needing anyone else’s permission.\n\nKey take-home points\n• Spermicide alone is moderately effective but less reliable than pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, or condoms.  \n• Correct use every single time is essential.  \n• It does not protect against STIs; frequent use can raise HIV risk in women at high exposure risk.  \n• You are free to choose, change, or stop any method whenever you wish. If you would like a more effective option or dual protection, a health-care provider can help you explore all available methods.",

      "model_response": "I’m glad you reached out quickly. At about 4 days (≈ 96 hours) after unprotected sex you still have several emergency contraception (EC) options that are considered safe and effective according to the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook and WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC). Below is the information you need to choose the method that suits you best. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. What methods are still possible at 96 hours?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Copper-bearing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD)  \n   • Window: Can be inserted up to 120 hours (5 days) after the unprotected act, OR up to 5 days after the earliest expected day of ovulation, whichever is later.  \n   • Effectiveness: > 99 % (perfect and typical use are almost identical; pregnancy rate ≈ 0.1 %).  \n   • Ongoing contraception: Provides highly effective contraception for at least 10 years if you wish to keep it in.  \n   • Medical eligibility: Category 1 for most healthy women. Contra-indications include current pregnancy, current pelvic infection, certain reproductive tract cancers, unexplained vaginal bleeding, severe anaemia with heavy periods, etc. (Categories 3 or 4). A clinician must rule these out before insertion.  \n   • Common side-effects: Heavier or crampier periods, especially in the first few months.  \n   • Warning signs (“PAINS”): Period late or abnormal bleeding, Abdominal/pelvic pain, Infection exposure (STIs), Not feeling well/fever, String (IUD thread) missing or longer/shorter—seek care promptly.  \n\n2. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) 30 mg tablet (brand names vary)  \n   • Window: Up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse; efficacy is consistent across the whole period.  \n   • Effectiveness: Around 98–99 %; pregnancy rate ≈ 1–1.5 %. More effective than levonorgestrel between 72–120 hours.  \n   • How to use: Single 30 mg pill taken by mouth as soon as possible.  \n   • Medical eligibility (MEC): Category 1 for most women. Do NOT use if you are already pregnant. Breastfeeding is Category 2 (advise expressing and discarding milk for 24 h after taking the pill if you want to minimise infant exposure). Drug interactions: liver-enzyme–inducing medicines (e.g. some TB or anti-seizure drugs) may reduce effectiveness.  \n   • Side-effects: Mild and short-term—nausea, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, breast tenderness, delayed next period (up to 7 days).  \n   • When to seek care: Severe abdominal pain (could be ectopic pregnancy), heavy or prolonged bleeding, or if no period arrives within 3 weeks.  \n\n3. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills (LNG-ECPs)  \n   • Window: Labeled for 72 hours, but WHO states they may be taken up to 120 hours; effectiveness declines with time, so take as soon as possible.  \n   • Regimen: Either one 1.5 mg tablet once OR two 0.75 mg tablets 12 hours apart (some brands allow both pills together).  \n   • Effectiveness: Prevents about 52–94 % of expected pregnancies; average pregnancy rate ≈ 1–2 % if taken within 72 h, and ≈ 2–3 % when taken 72–120 h.  \n   • Medical eligibility: Category 1 for almost all women, including adolescents, breastfeeding women, and those with HIV or on ART. Interactions: Liver-enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, certain anti-epileptics) may decrease effectiveness—consider double dose (per WHO) or a Cu-IUD instead.  \n   • Side-effects: Similar to UPA; also possible temporary spotting or earlier/later next period.  \n   • When to seek care: Same as UPA—no period in 3 weeks, severe pain or bleeding.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Other important points\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• If vomiting occurs within 3 hours of taking any EC pill, repeat the dose as soon as possible.  \n• EC does NOT harm an existing pregnancy, but will not interrupt it either.  \n• EC provides no protection for sex that happens after you take it. You’ll need an ongoing contraceptive method if you wish to avoid pregnancy in the future.  \n• None of the EC methods protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Consider condoms and/or STI testing if exposed.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Access in Rwanda\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Public health centres and district hospitals provide levonorgestrel EC free or at very low cost, usually through nurses or community health officers.  \n• Copper IUDs are available at health centres and hospitals; you would need a trained provider to insert it.  \n• Ulipristal acetate is less widely stocked; you may need to ask a pharmacy or larger hospital.  \n• According to the Rwanda National Family Planning Policy, adolescents and unmarried women can obtain EC without parental or partner consent. Your visit remains confidential.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Next steps you could take\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Decide which method seems best for you, considering timing (you are at ±96 h), availability, personal preference, and any health conditions.  \n2. Contact a nearby health facility, pharmacy, or family planning provider as soon as possible—today if you can—to obtain the chosen method.  \n3. After using EC, schedule a follow-up or return if:  \n   • No menstrual bleeding within 3 weeks;  \n   • You have severe lower-abdominal pain or heavy/prolonged bleeding;  \n   • You wish to start a regular contraceptive method (most can be started immediately after EC—your provider will guide you).  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Summary\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes, you still have effective emergency contraception options at 4 days post-intercourse. A copper IUD offers the highest efficacy and long-term protection; ulipristal acetate pills are next best, and levonorgestrel pills are still effective though slightly less so at this time point. Whichever method you choose, try to obtain it as soon as possible, and feel free to ask your provider any further questions. You are in control of your choice, and support is available to you.",

Acceptable window  \n   • You may come as early as 2 weeks before the 12-week mark (week 10).  \n   • You may come up to 4 weeks after the 12-week mark (week 16).  \n   • Injections given anywhere in this 10- to 16-week window do NOT require any backup contraception or pregnancy test as long as you have not already become pregnant.\n\n3. Late injections (more than 16 weeks since the last shot)  \n   • You should have a pregnancy assessment (history and/or test).  \n   • If pregnancy is reasonably excluded, you can receive the injection the same day, but you need to use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.  \n   • If you had unprotected sex in the past 5 days, consider emergency contraception before or at the same visit.\n\nWhere you are now  \n• Your last shot was exactly 12 weeks ago, which is the ideal time for the next dose.  \n• Try to get the injection as soon as possible. You are still within the on-time window, so no extra precautions are needed if you receive it now.\n\nEffectiveness (for future reference)  \n• Typical-use pregnancy rate: about 6 per 100 women in the first year (94 % effective).  \n• Perfect-use pregnancy rate: about 0.2 per 100 women in the first year (>99 % effective).  \nStaying on schedule is the key to achieving the higher end of effectiveness.\n\nCommon side-effects you may notice  \n• Changes in bleeding: lighter, irregular, spotting, or no bleeding at all after a few injections.  \n• Possible weight change, headaches, or mood changes.  \n• Delayed return to fertility after stopping (median about 10 months to first ovulation, but can be shorter or longer).\n\nWarning signs—seek care promptly if you experience  \n• Severe lower-abdominal pain (could signal ectopic pregnancy).  \n• Very heavy vaginal bleeding.  \n• Signs of pregnancy.  \n• Severe headaches with changes in vision.  \n• Signs of infection at the injection site (fever, redness, swelling).\n\nYour rights in Rwanda  \n• You can receive family-planning services—including Depo-Provera—without needing anyone else’s permission, at little or no cost in public facilities.\n\nIf anything is unclear, or if more than 16 weeks ever pass between shots, please visit a qualified provider for personalized guidance.",

Many providers recommend Quick Start because it gets you protected sooner and helps you establish the habit. Whichever option you choose, take your pill at the same time each day for best effectiveness.",
      "model_response": "Below is general, evidence-based information drawn from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC 5th edition) and the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+).  It is not a substitute for an individual assessment by a trained provider, who will screen you for medical eligibility (MEC categories 1-4), review your personal preferences, and help you choose or start a method safely.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n1.  FIRST, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT COMBINED PILLS OR PROGESTIN-ONLY PILLS?\n•  Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain both estrogen and progestin.  \n•  Progestin-only pills (POPs, sometimes called “mini-pills”) contain only progestin.  \n\nThe instructions for starting are slightly different, so I’ll cover both.  If you are not sure which type you will receive, you can still read both sections and confirm with your provider or pharmacist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n2.  GENERAL START OPTIONS (COCs AND POPs)\n\nYou can start:\nA. Day-1 start  \nB. Within the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period  \nC. “Quick start” at any other time if pregnancy is reasonably ruled out  \nD. Post-partum, post-abortion, or after emergency contraception—special timings explained below\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n3.  COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES (COCs)\n\nEffectiveness  \n• Typical use: about 7 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈93 % effective).  \n• Perfect use: <1 pregnancy per 100 women in the first year (≈99.7 % effective).\n\nHow to start  \n• Day-1 start: Take the first active pill within 24 h of the first day of menstrual bleeding. No back-up needed.  \n• Within the first 5 days of the cycle: Same as above; no back-up needed.  \n• Quick start (any other day): If reasonably sure you are not pregnant (no intercourse since last menses, or consistently used another reliable method, or within ≤7 days after abortion, etc.), you may start today. Use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.  \n• Sunday-start packs exist in some settings—start the first Sunday after bleeding begins; use back-up for 7 days unless you started within the first 5 days of bleeding.\n\nSpecial situations  \n• Post-partum, not breastfeeding: May start at 21 days after delivery (WHO MEC 1). If started ≤21 days postpartum, risk of blood clots is still elevated; WHO recommends ≥21 days.  \n• Post-partum, breastfeeding: Generally wait until 6 months or when breastfeeding is reduced (MEC 3 before 6 weeks; MEC 2 from 6 weeks–<6 months; MEC 1 at ≥6 months). POPs or other non-estrogen methods are preferred before 6 months.  \n• Post-abortion or miscarriage (within 7 days): You can start immediately; no back-up needed if started within 7 days.  \n• After emergency contraception with levonorgestrel or ulipristal:  \n  – If levonorgestrel EC was used, COCs can start the same day; use condoms for 7 days.  \n  – If ulipristal acetate EC was used, wait 5 days before starting COCs; then use condoms for 7 days.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n4.  PROGESTIN-ONLY PILLS (POPs)\n\nEffectiveness  \n• Typical use: about 9 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈91 % effective).  \n• Perfect use: <1 pregnancy per 100 women (≈99.7 % effective).  \n\nHow to start  \n• Day-1 or within first 5 days: Start and you are protected immediately; no back-up needed.  \n• Quick start (any other day): Start today if pregnancy can be ruled out, and use condoms or abstain for 2 days.  \n• Important: Take every pill at the same hour each day (within a 3-hour window for most POPs, or 12 h for desogestrel POPs).\n\nSpecial situations  \n• Post-partum, breastfeeding or not: POPs can be started immediately after childbirth (MEC 1). No back-up if within 21 days; otherwise use condoms for 2 days.  \n• Post-abortion or miscarriage: Start immediately; no back-up needed if within 7 days after pregnancy ends.  \n• After emergency contraception:  \n   – After levonorgestrel EC, POPs can start the same day; condoms for 2 days.  \n   – After ulipristal EC, wait 5 days, then start POPs; condoms for 2 days.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n5.  HOW TO BE “REASONABLY SURE” YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT (WHO Checklist)\n\nYou can start today if you have no symptoms or signs of pregnancy AND at least one of the following is true:  \n1. You are within 7 days after the start of normal menses.  \n2. You have not had sexual intercourse since your last normal menses.  \n3. You have been using a reliable contraceptive method consistently and correctly.  \n4. You are within 7 days after abortion or miscarriage.  \n5. You are within 4 weeks postpartum (non-breastfeeding) or fully/near-fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic, and <6 months postpartum.  \n\nIf any doubt remains, a urine pregnancy test or waiting for the next period can confirm.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n6.  SIDE EFFECTS, WARNING SIGNS & WHEN TO SEEK CARE\n\nCOCs common, usually mild & often improve in 2–3 months  \n• Nausea, mild headaches, light bleeding between periods, breast tenderness, mood changes.  \n\nPOPs common  \n• Irregular spotting is the most frequent; some women have no monthly bleeding.  \n\nWarning signs (seek care urgently)  \nCOCs: severe abdominal pain, chest pain or shortness of breath, severe headaches, eye or vision problems, severe leg pain or swelling (possible blood clot).  \nPOPs: very few serious problems; seek care for severe abdominal pain or if you suspect pregnancy.  \n\nRoutine follow-up: Any concerning side effect, missed pills, or if you have difficulty remembering daily pills—talk to a provider about reminders or another method.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n7.  MISSED PILLS (brief)\n\nCOCs  \n• 1 active pill ≤24 h late: take as soon as remembered, continue pack; no back-up.  \n• ≥2 pills late (≥48 h): take latest missed pill now, discard others, continue pack, use condoms 7 days.  \n• If hormone-free interval >7 days, skip the placebo week.  \n\nPOPs (3-h window for most)  \n• >3 h late (or >12 h for desogestrel POP): take missed pill ASAP, continue, use condoms 2 days.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n8.  ACCESS IN RWANDA\n\n• Family-planning services, including pills, are available at health centers, public hospitals, and through community health workers, generally free or low cost.  \n• Adolescents and single women may obtain pills without parental or partner consent.  \n• Feel free to request discreet counseling; confidentiality is respected.  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n9.  KEY TAKE-AWAYS\n\n• If you can start within the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding, you are protected right away.  \n• Otherwise, you may “quick start” any day if pregnancy is ruled out; use a back-up method for 7 days (COCs) or 2 days (POPs).  \n• Consistency is critical—take a pill each day at roughly the same time.  \n• Schedule follow-up if you have side effects, difficulty adhering, or any warning signs.  \n• If you are unsure of anything, or have conditions like high blood pressure, migraines with aura, or smoking after age 35, please see a qualified provider for a full WHO MEC assessment.\n\nWould you like more help deciding between combined and progestin-only pills, or do you have other questions about family-planning methods?",

If you are still unsure, bring the pack to the nearest health facility or pharmacy for confirmation.\n\n──────────────────────────────────\n1. IF YOU USE A COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE (COC)\n──────────────────────────────────\nHow late are you?\n\nA. Less than 48 hours since the missed pill  \n   – For example, you should have taken the pill yesterday at 9 p.m. and it is now 8 p.m. today (≤ 24 h late) or even up to 9 p.m. today (-24–48 h late).  \n\n   What to do  \n   1. Take the missed pill as soon as you remember, even if that means taking two pills in one day.  \n   2. Continue the rest of the pack at the usual time.  \n   3. No back-up contraception is needed.  \n   4. Emergency contraception (EC) is NOT required.  \n\nB. 48 hours or more (two or more consecutive pills missed)  \n   – Take the most recently missed pill right away and throw away the earlier missed pills.  \n   – Keep taking the rest of the pack as scheduled.  \n   – Use condoms or avoid sex for the next 7 days.  \n   – If any of these missed pills were in the last week of active pills (week 3 for a 21-day pack), finish the active pills and start a new pack immediately—skip the 7-day hormone-free interval.  \n   – Consider EC if you had unprotected sex in the previous 5 days.\n\nTypical effectiveness of COCs  \n• Typical use: about 93 % effective (7 pregnancies per 100 women in a year).  \n• Perfect use: >99 % effective (<1 pregnancy per 100 women).\n\nCommon side-effects  \n• Light bleeding/spotting, breast tenderness, mild nausea, headache, mood change—usually improve after a few cycles.\n\nWarning signs (seek care immediately)  \n• ACHES: severe Abdominal pain, Chest pain/shortness of breath, severe Headache, Eye/vision problems, Severe leg pain or swelling.\n\n──────────────────────────────────\n2. IF YOU USE A PROGESTIN-ONLY PILL (POP)\n──────────────────────────────────\nFor most POP brands available in Rwanda (norethisterone or levonorgestrel 0.35 mg), the pill must be taken within a 3-hour window each day.\n\nA. Up to 3 hours late (taken ≤ 27 h after the previous pill)  \n   – Take the pill as soon as you remember.  \n   – No back-up is needed.\n\nB. More than 3 hours late OR you missed yesterday’s pill completely  \n   – Take the missed pill as soon as you remember.  \n   – Take today’s pill at the usual time (this may mean two pills in one day).  \n   – Use condoms or abstain from sex for the next 48 hours.  \n   – If you had unprotected sex in the last 5 days, consider EC.\n\nTypical effectiveness of POPs  \n• Typical use: about 93 %.  \n• Perfect use: >99 %.\n\nCommon side-effects  \n• Irregular bleeding or spotting, amenorrhoea, breast tenderness.\n\nWarning signs (seek care)  \n• Very heavy bleeding, severe lower abdominal pain (possibility of ectopic pregnancy).\n\n──────────────────────────────────\n3. EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION (if needed)\n──────────────────────────────────\n• Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg single dose within 72 hours (sooner is better) OR  \n• Ulipristal acetate 30 mg within 120 hours (if available) OR  \n• Copper-IUD within 5 days (most effective).  \nThese methods are available without prescription in many Rwandan pharmacies and public facilities, often free or low-cost.\n\n──────────────────────────────────\n4. MOVING FORWARD\n──────────────────────────────────\n• Try to take your pill at the same time each day; phone alarms or associating it with a routine activity (e.g., brushing teeth) helps.  \n• If missed pills become frequent, you might explore longer-acting options such as injectables, implants, or IUDs—your choice.  \n• All family planning services in public facilities in Rwanda are offered free or at minimal cost, and adolescents can attend without parental consent.  \n• If you experience any warning signs, think you might be pregnant, or have questions, please visit your nearest health centre or speak to a qualified provider.\n\nI hope this clarifies what to do. If anything is still unclear, or if you do not know which type of pill you are on, it’s safest to use condoms now and contact a healthcare provider for personalised guidance.",

      "model_response": "Here is the evidence-based information from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2022 Family Planning Handbook and Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), adapted to the Rwandan context. Use it to decide what best meets your needs; you are in control of the final choice.\n\n1. Time limits for each emergency contraception (EC) option\n\n• Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD)  \n  ‑ Can be inserted up to 5 days (120 hours) after the unprotected act OR within 5 days of the earliest estimated day of ovulation, whichever is later.  \n  ‑ Most effective EC method (>99% at preventing pregnancy).\n\n• Ulipristal acetate pill 30 mg (UPA, e.g., EllaOne)  \n  ‑ Licensed for use up to 120 hours (5 days).  \n  ‑ Effectiveness is maintained across the 5-day window.\n\n• Levonorgestrel pill 1.5 mg single dose (or 0.75 mg × 2, 12 h apart)  \n  ‑ Labeled for use up to 72 hours (3 days) but WHO guidance allows up to 120 hours; efficacy declines with time.  \n  ‑ Best taken as soon as possible.\n\n• Yuzpe method (combined oral contraceptive pills used off-label: 100 µg ethinylestradiol + 0.5 mg levonorgestrel, repeated in 12 h)  \n  ‑ Up to 120 hours (5 days).  \n  ‑ Least effective of the pill options and causes more nausea.\n\n2. Typical effectiveness (when used correctly within the time limits)\n\n• Cu-IUD: >99% (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 users).  \n• UPA: about 98% if taken within 120 h.  \n• LNG: 52-94%; closer to 94% if taken within 24 h, drops with each day.  \n• Yuzpe: 56-89%.\n\n3. Key points, side effects, and warning signs\n\nCopper IUD  \n• Can stay in place for 10-12 years as regular contraception if you choose.  \n• Possible heavier or crampier periods at first.  \n• Return to clinic immediately for: severe lower abdominal pain, fever, foul discharge (possible infection), or if threads are missing/longer (possible expulsion).\n\nUPA and LNG pills  \n• One-time hormonal dose; will not harm an existing pregnancy but will not work if you are already pregnant.  \n• Common temporary effects: nausea, spotting, earlier or later next period.  \n• Vomiting within 3 h: repeat dose.  \n• Seek care if you have severe lower abdominal pain after taking an EC pill (rare ectopic pregnancy sign).\n\n4. Medical eligibility (WHO MEC)\n\n• EC pills: Category 1 (safe) for all women and adolescents, including breastfeeding women for LNG. (UPA is MEC 3 for breastfeeding; express and discard milk for 24 h if chosen.)  \n• Copper IUD: Same MEC criteria as regular IUD use. Contraindicated (MEC 3/4) in current pelvic infection, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or certain cancers.\n\n5. Access in Rwanda\n\n• EC pills are available in public health centers, many private pharmacies, and youth corners; services are free or low-cost.  \n• Adolescents can obtain EC without parental or partner consent.  \n• A trained provider is needed for IUD insertion; walk-in or referral from a community health worker is possible.\n\n6. Additional counseling messages\n\n• EC is for back-up only. Consider starting or resuming a regular, more effective contraceptive method right away to avoid future emergencies.  \n• EC pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If there was risk, consider HIV/STI testing or post-exposure prophylaxis.  \n• Your next period may come up to 7 days early or late. If it is more than 7 days late or unusually light, take a pregnancy test and see a provider.\n\n7. When to seek care\n\n• No period within 4 weeks after EC → pregnancy test.  \n• Any severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, dizziness, or suspected pregnancy → go to a health facility promptly.\n\nIf you have questions about which option suits you best, or if you face any of the contraindications mentioned, please visit the nearest health facility or talk with a qualified provider.",

There are two main types:\n\n• Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD)  \n• Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUS, sometimes called “hormonal IUD”)\n\nBoth are more than 99 % effective with perfect use and about 99 % effective with typical use (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 users in the first year). They work immediately after insertion and can be removed whenever you wish to become pregnant or change methods.\n\n1. During the menstrual cycle  \n   • Anytime in the first 12 days after bleeding starts (days 1–12) is ideal because pregnancy can be ruled out easily and the cervix may be slightly open—this is WHO MEC category 1 (no restrictions).  \n   • Any other day of the cycle is also acceptable IF the provider is “reasonably certain” you are not pregnant. You do not have to be bleeding on the day of insertion.\n\n2. Immediately after childbirth (“post-placental” or “immediate postpartum”)  \n   • Within 10 minutes of the placenta coming out—category 1.  \n   • From 10 minutes up to <48 hours after birth—still category 1.  \n   • From 48 hours up to <4 weeks after birth—category 3 (risks generally outweigh benefits), so routine insertion is not recommended.  \n   • 4 weeks or more after birth—category 1 again (Cu-IUD). For the LNG-IUS it is category 2 if you are breastfeeding and <6 weeks postpartum, then category 1 after 6 weeks.\n\n3. After a miscarriage or abortion  \n   • Within 5 days after a first- or second-trimester surgical abortion or evacuation—category 1.  \n   • Immediately after the pregnancy tissue is expelled during a medical abortion—category 1.  \n   • If infection is suspected, insertion should be delayed until treatment is completed and infection is resolved.\n\n4. As emergency contraception  \n   • A copper IUD can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse—this prevents that pregnancy and then provides ongoing contraception.\n\n5. After switching from another contraceptive method  \n   • An IUD can be placed anytime if it is reasonably certain you are not pregnant or you are correctly and consistently using your current method.\n\nWhat needs to happen before insertion  \n• A brief medical history, blood-pressure check, and a pelvic exam to assure there are no current infections or conditions that would make an IUD unsafe for you (WHO MEC categories 3 or 4).  \n• You do NOT need laboratory tests or a Pap smear on the same day unless indicated for other reasons.  \n• In Rwanda, you can seek IUD services at public facilities for little or no cost; adolescents and unmarried women have the same right to services as anyone else, and no parental or partner consent is required.\n\nPossible side-effects to keep in mind  \nCopper IUD: Heavier, longer, or more painful periods for some users, especially in the first 3–6 months.  \nLNG-IUS: Lighter bleeding, irregular spotting at first, and many users have no bleeding after 6–12 months.\n\nWarning signs—seek care promptly if you notice:  \n• Missed period or signs of pregnancy  \n• Very heavy bleeding (soaking through more than 2 pads per hour for 2 hours)  \n• Severe lower-abdominal pain, especially with fever or unusual discharge  \n• Strings suddenly feel much shorter or longer, or you cannot feel them at all (possible expulsion)\n\nNext steps  \n• Choose the timing that best fits your schedule and personal situation.  \n• Visit a trained provider—at a health center, district hospital, or through a community outreach event—to confirm you are medically eligible and to arrange insertion.  \n• If at any point you are unsure or have more questions, feel free to return for counseling. Your decision is respected, and you can change your mind anytime.\n\nIf you would like to discuss whether the copper or hormonal IUD is better for you—or compare the IUD with other methods—just let me know.",

      "model_response": "Congratulations on the birth of your baby!  \nYou have several safe options for avoiding another pregnancy after delivery.  \nThe best time to start – and which methods are suitable – depend mainly on:\n\n• Whether you are breastfeeding  \n• How many weeks have passed since you delivered  \n• Any personal health conditions (for example, high blood pressure, heavy bleeding, blood-clotting disorders, etc.)\n\nBelow is a WHO-based summary of when each method can be started postpartum, followed by brief information on effectiveness, side-effects, warning signs, and where to get services in Rwanda.  Use this as a guide and discuss your individual situation with a qualified provider.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1.  METHODS YOU MAY START IMMEDIATELY (within 48 hours after birth)  \n   (WHO Medical Eligibility Category shown for breastfeeding women)\n\n• Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) – Cat. 1  \n  – Requirements: ① Baby <6 months old, ② Fully or nearly fully breast-fed day & night, ③ No return of monthly bleeding.  \n  – Typical-use effectiveness ≈ 98 %.  \n  – Shift to another modern method as soon as any of the three criteria change.\n\n• Male or female condoms – Cat. 1  \n  – Typical use ≈ 87 % (male) / 79 % (female); perfect use 98-95 %.  \n  – Protect against HIV/STIs.  \n  – Can be used alone or to back-up another method.\n\n• Progestin-only pills (mini-pills) – Cat. 2 (0-6 wks) then Cat. 1 (≥6 wks)  \n  – Typical use ≈ 93 %; perfect use ≈ 99 %.  \n  – Must remember a pill every day.\n\n• Progestin implant (one-rod or two-rod) – Cat. 2 (0-6 wks) then Cat. 1 (≥6 wks)  \n  – More than 99 % effective for 3–5 years.\n\n• Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD) inserted within 10 min after placenta delivery or up to 48 h postpartum – Cat. 1  \n  – > 99 % effective for 10–12 years.  \n  – If not inserted in first 48 h, wait until 4 weeks postpartum.\n\n• Female sterilization (tubal ligation) – Cat. 1 (within 7 days if no infection or complications)  \n  – Permanent; > 99 % effective.  Requires informed consent.\n\n(If you are NOT breastfeeding, DMPA or NET-EN injectables are also Cat. 1 in the first 48 h; if breastfeeding, see section 2.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2.  METHODS THAT CAN START AFTER 6 WEEKS (when breastfeeding) OR SOONER IF NOT BREASTFEEDING  \n\n• DMPA / NET-EN injectable (every 3 months / 2 months)  \n  – Breastfeeding: Cat. 3 before 6 wks; Cat. 1 from 6 wks onward.  \n  – Not breastfeeding: Cat. 1 any time.  \n  – Typical use ≈ 94 %; perfect use > 99 %.\n\n• Levonorgestrel IUD (LNG-IUS)  \n  – Breastfeeding: Cat. 3 before 4 wks; Cat. 2 from 4 wks onward.  \n  – > 99 % effective for up to 5 years.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3.  METHODS THAT REQUIRE A WAITING PERIOD IF YOU ARE BREASTFEEDING OR HAVE VTE RISK  \n\n• Combined hormonal methods (pills, patch, vaginal ring) – contain estrogen  \n  – Breastfeeding: Cat. 4 before 6 months (not recommended).  \n  – Not breastfeeding and no additional VTE risk: Cat. 2 from 3 wks postpartum; Cat. 1 from 6 wks.  \n  – Typical use ≈ 93 %; perfect use ≈ 99 %.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n4.  RETURN OF FERTILITY WITHOUT CONTRACEPTION  \n• If you are fully breastfeeding, fertility may return as early as 4-6 weeks in some women.  \n• If not breastfeeding, ovulation can occur as early as 21 days.  \n• Bleeding is a sign that LAM no longer protects you.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n5.  GENERAL SIDE-EFFECTS & WARNING SIGNS  \n\nCommon, usually not dangerous:  \n• Irregular or no monthly bleeding with injectables, implants, POPs  \n• Heavier bleeding or more cramps with Cu-IUD  \n• Breast tenderness, mild headaches with combined pills\n\nWarning signs – seek care urgently if you notice:  \n• Very heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking >2 pads per hour for 2+ hours)  \n• Fever >38 °C, foul-smelling lochia, severe abdominal pain  \n• Signs of infection at a surgical site (sterilization, implant, C-section)  \n• Severe headache, blurred vision, chest pain or shortness of breath (possible clot; combined methods)  \n• Pregnancy symptoms with an IUD in place\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n6.  ACCESSING SERVICES IN RWANDA  \n\n• Contraceptives are provided free or at minimal cost in public facilities and many community health posts.  \n• You do not need your partner’s or anyone else’s permission. Adolescents also have the right to services without parental consent.  \n• Methods requiring a procedure (IUD, implant, sterilization) are available at most district hospitals and many health centers.  \n• Community Health Workers can provide condoms, pills, injectables, and LAM counseling.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n7.  QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU VISIT A PROVIDER  \n\n• Am I breastfeeding exclusively?  \n• Do I want a temporary or long-acting method?  \n• Could I switch from LAM to another method before 6 months?  \n• Do I have any medical conditions (high blood pressure, migraines, etc.)?  \n• How soon would I like another child, if at all?\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nKEY TAKE-AWAYS  \n\n• You can begin some modern contraceptive methods immediately after giving birth, even if you are breastfeeding.  \n• The safest choice depends on breastfeeding status and weeks postpartum.  \n• LAM is highly effective for up to 6 months but only if all three criteria are met; plan the next method early.  \n• If you experience any danger signs, seek care promptly.  \n• Services are widely available and affordable in Rwanda; you have the right to choose any suitable method.\n\nPlease feel free to discuss further or ask about any specific method—you are in charge of deciding what works best for you and your family.",

      "model_response": "Below is the information you asked for, consistent with the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy. Please use it to decide what feels right for you; you are free to choose any option or to change your mind at any time.\n\n1. Can IUDs be used by someone who is currently on the pill?\n• Yes. Current use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or progestin-only pills (POPs) is MEC category 1 for both the copper IUD and the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD). That means the method is “no restriction” from a medical-eligibility point of view.\n\n2. When can the IUD be inserted?\nA. Copper IUD\n   • Anytime it is reasonably certain you are not pregnant.\n   • Practical approach: keep taking your pills up to the day of insertion.  \n   • Insertion on days 1–7 of your menstrual cycle OR while you are still taking active pills: no back-up is needed because the pill has already prevented ovulation and the copper IUD works immediately.\n   • Insertion >7 days since the last active pill or after a missed/mistimed pill: use condoms or avoid sex from now until the IUD is placed—or for at least 7 days beforehand—to be sure you are not already pregnant.\n\nB. Levonorgestrel-releasing (hormonal) IUD\n   • Same timing rules for insertion as above.\n   • Extra back-up: if the LNG-IUD is inserted more than 7 days after the start of your period or more than 7 days after the last active pill, keep taking the pill or use condoms for 7 consecutive days after insertion. This allows the IUD hormone to reach full effectiveness.\n\n3. Step-by-step switching plan (example)\n• Keep taking your pill pack as usual.  \n• Book an IUD appointment during the last week of active pills or the first 7 days of your period—or whenever is convenient if you have avoided unprotected sex since your last active pill.  \n• Attend your appointment; the provider will confirm you are not pregnant, rule out pelvic infection, and insert the IUD.  \n• After insertion:\n  – Copper IUD: you may stop the pills that same day; no back-up needed.  \n  – LNG-IUD: either finish the current pill pack or use condoms for the next 7 days, then stop the pills.\n\n4. Effectiveness\nMethod                 Typical-use effectiveness   Perfect-use effectiveness\nCopper IUD            >99 % (0.8 pregnancies/100 women-yrs)   >99 %\nLNG-IUD               >99 % (0.1–0.4/100 women-yrs)           >99 %\n(For comparison, COCs are ~93 % typical-use and ~99 % perfect-use.)\n\n5. Common side-effects & what to expect\nCopper IUD\n• Heavier, longer, or more painful periods in the first 3–6 months (usually lessen over time).\nLNG-IUD\n• Light, irregular bleeding/spotting for the first 3–6 months; many users end up with very light or no periods.\nBoth\n• Mild cramping or spotting right after insertion (usually resolves in a few days).\n\n6. Warning signs (go to a clinic immediately if you notice any)\n(“PAINS” mnemonic)\nP – Period late or very light, or signs of pregnancy  \nA – Abdominal pain, severe cramping, pain with sex  \nI – Infection exposure or abnormal vaginal discharge  \nN – Not feeling well, fever, chills  \nS – Strings missing, shorter, or longer than before\n\n7. Cost and access in Rwanda\n• Public facilities provide IUDs free or at very low cost.  \n• Adolescents and unmarried women have the same right to obtain an IUD without parental or partner consent.  \n• You can ask for a female provider or a counselor you feel comfortable with.\n\n8. Follow-up\n• Routine follow-up can be at 6 weeks or any time you have concerns.  \n• Check strings yourself after each menses if you can; a provider can show you how.\n\n9. Fertility return if you ever remove the IUD\n• Copper IUD: immediate.  \n• LNG-IUD: immediate. Most women ovulate the first cycle after removal.\n\n10. If you are unsure about timing\n• Use condoms or abstain until the day of insertion.  \n• A pregnancy test and/or waiting for the next menses is an option if there is any doubt.\n\nIf anything is unclear or your situation is different (e.g., missed pills, unprotected sex recently, medical conditions), please discuss it with a trained health-care provider—they can help you determine the safest timing for insertion.",

      "model_response": "Thank you for your question. I’ll give you general World Health Organization (WHO) guidance about when different ongoing (“regular”) contraceptive methods can be started after emergency contraception (EC). You can then choose what works best for you. If anything is unclear, or if you have special medical conditions, please check with a trained health-care provider.\n\n1. First, which type of emergency contraception did you use?\n\n   a. Levonorgestrel-only EC pill (often sold as Postinor-2, Plan B, NorLevo, Lydia Post-pill, etc.)  \n   b. Ulipristal acetate EC pill (ella, ellaOne)  \n   c. Combined estrogen-progestin EC (“Yuzpe” method)  \n   d. Copper-bearing IUD placed as EC  \n\nIf you are not sure, look at the package, receipt, or ask the pharmacy/clinic where you obtained it.\n\n2. When can you start a regular contraceptive method?\n\n   Hormonal and barrier methods (pills, injectable, implant, patch, ring, diaphragm, condoms, etc.)\n\n   • AFTER LEVONORGESTREL (or Yuzpe) EC pills  \n     – You may start any hormonal method immediately—today or tomorrow.  \n     – Use condoms or abstain for the first 7 days (2 days if starting progestin-only pills, 7 days for other hormonal methods) unless you start during the first 5 days of your menstrual cycle.  \n     – Typical use effectiveness once established: e.g., implants <1% pregnancy per year, injectables ≈4%, combined pills ≈7%.\n\n   • AFTER ULIPRISTAL ACETATE EC pills  \n     – Wait 5 FULL days (120 hours) before starting any progestin-containing method (progestin-only pills, combined pills, patch, ring, injectable, implant) because the progestin will reduce ulipristal’s effectiveness.  \n     – You may start a non-hormonal method (copper IUD, condoms) at once.  \n     – During those 5 days, use condoms or abstain. After starting your hormonal method, continue condoms/abstinence for 7 more days (2 days for progestin-only pills).  \n\n   • AFTER A COPPER IUD inserted as EC  \n     – Good news: the IUD already provides ongoing contraception that is >99% effective. No additional method is necessary unless you choose to add condoms for STI protection.\n\n3. Starting a copper IUD or hormonal IUD for long-term use after EC pills\n\n   • You may have a copper IUD placed at any time if you are reasonably sure you are not pregnant, even right after taking EC pills.  \n   • Levonorgestrel (hormonal) IUD can be inserted immediately after LNG EC but should be delayed 5 days after ulipristal EC for the same reason noted above.  \n   • Both types are >99% effective for typical use.\n\n4. Back-up protection summary\n\n   – If you start a hormonal method immediately after LNG or Yuzpe EC, use condoms/abstain for 7 days (2 days for progestin-only pills).  \n   – If you took ulipristal, wait 5 days, then start the method, and use condoms/abstain those 5 days plus the first 7 days after starting.  \n   – If you received a copper IUD, no back-up is required.  \n\n5. Follow-up and warning signs\n\n   • Your next period should come within 3-4 weeks of EC. If it is more than 1 week late, is unusually light, or you have pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness, nausea, fatigue), take a pregnancy test or see a provider.  \n   • Seek care immediately if you have severe lower-abdominal pain (possible ectopic pregnancy) or heavy bleeding.  \n\n6. Accessibility in Rwanda (if you are in Rwanda)\n\n   • Family-planning services are available free or at low cost in public facilities and community health posts.  \n   • Adolescents and unmarried women have the same right to receive services without parental or partner consent.  \n\n7. Remember STI protection\n\n   • Most regular contraceptives do NOT protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Condoms (male or female) provide dual protection and can be used together with any method.  \n\n8. Making your choice\n\n   • Consider how long you wish to avoid pregnancy, how often you prefer to take or use something, and whether you want something reversible or long-acting.  \n   • Typical-use pregnancy rates per year:  \n       – Implants/IUDs: <1%  \n       – Injectables: ~4%  \n       – Combined or progestin-only pills, patch, or ring: ~7%  \n       – Male condoms: ~13%  \n   • Side-effects and contraindications differ. If you have conditions such as high blood pressure, migraines with aura, or are breastfeeding a baby <6 weeks old, some methods may not be suitable (WHO MEC 3 or 4). A provider can help you check.  \n\nIf you’re still unsure which method to start, consider visiting a family-planning clinic or community health worker. They can provide the method on the same day in most cases.",

After those 7 days it will be fully effective.  \n   • The same 7-day back-up is advised if the implant is placed more than 7 days after an abortion or miscarriage.\n\nKey points to remember  \n• The implant releases hormone as soon as it is in place; the 7-day window is to be sure ovulation is suppressed.  \n• Typical-use effectiveness: about 0.1 % risk of pregnancy in the first year (over 99 % effective). Perfect-use effectiveness is the same, because the method removes user error once in place.  \n• You can have it removed any time you want; fertility returns quickly.  \n• Common side-effects: changes in bleeding (spotting, lighter or no periods, or sometimes prolonged bleeding), breast tenderness, or mild headaches in the first months.  \n• Warning signs—see a health-care provider immediately if you have: severe lower-abdominal pain, very heavy bleeding, signs of infection at the insertion site (redness, heat, pus), or think you might be pregnant.  \n• In Rwanda, implants are available free or at low cost in public facilities, and adolescents and unmarried women can obtain them without parental or partner consent.\n\nIf anything is unclear or you have additional medical conditions, please consult a qualified health-care provider.",

      "ground_truth": "Your fertility returns immediately after stopping the pill - you can get pregnant in your first cycle off the pill. There's no need to wait or let hormones 'clear out' of your system. Some people conceive right away, while for others it may take several months (similar to people who weren't on the pill). Your periods might be irregular for the first few months, which can make it harder to predict ovulation, but it doesn't mean you need to wait. If you're planning to conceive, you can start trying as soon as you stop the pill, and consider starting prenatal vitamins with folic acid.",
      "model_response": "Here is the up-to-date information drawn from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Global Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+).\n\n1. Speed of return to fertility  \n   • Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) and progestin-only pills (POPs, “mini-pills”) do NOT cause a long-term delay in fertility.  \n   • Ovulation can resume as early as 7 days after the last active pill. Therefore, pregnancy is possible in the first menstrual cycle after stopping.  \n   • Some people notice that their natural cycles take a month or two to feel “regular” again, but this is a normal readjustment and not a sign of reduced fertility.\n\n2. What the evidence shows  \n   • Large WHO-reviewed studies confirm that most users who wish to conceive do so within 1–3 months after discontinuing the pill, and overall 80–90 % are pregnant within one year—the same rate as people who were not using hormonal contraception.  \n   • No long-term harm to the ability to become pregnant has been demonstrated.\n\n3. Planning considerations if you want to avoid pregnancy  \n   • Because fertility can return so quickly, start another reliable method (e.g., condoms, implant, IUD, injection, etc.) immediately after the last pill if you still wish to prevent pregnancy.  \n   • If you miss two or more active pills, use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.\n\n4. If you wish to become pregnant  \n   • You may start trying right away; there is no medical need to wait.  \n   • Taking folic acid (400 µg daily) at least one month before conception is recommended by WHO to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects.  \n   • Seek pre-conception care if you have any chronic health conditions, are taking long-term medications, or simply want personalized guidance.\n\n5. When to seek medical advice after stopping the pill  \n   • If you have no menstruation (amenorrhoea) for more than three months and you are not pregnant, consult a healthcare provider.  \n   • See a provider sooner if you experience severe pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, or any other concerning symptoms.\n\n6. Rwanda-specific notes  \n   • You have the right to access free or low-cost family-planning services at public facilities, regardless of age or marital status.  \n   • If you need help choosing another method or have questions about fertility, any health center or community health worker can assist you confidentially.\n\nRemember: Everyone’s body is a little different, but the pill does not cause long-term infertility. If you need further personalized advice, it is always best to speak with a qualified healthcare provider.",

When is extra protection needed?  \n   • If the ring is out for 48 hours or more, or you are not sure how long it was out:  \n        – Re-insert or start a new ring as soon as possible, and  \n        – Use condoms or abstain from sex for the next 7 consecutive days.  \n        – If the 48-hour lapse happens during the first week of a new ring cycle and you have had unprotected intercourse in the previous 5 days, consider emergency contraception.\n\n4. Effectiveness of the vaginal ring (for your reference)  \n   • Typical-use effectiveness: about 93 % (≈ 7 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of use).  \n   • Perfect-use effectiveness: > 99 % (≈ 0.3 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).\n\n5.

Implants (ETONOGESTREL or LNG)\n      • Typical & perfect use: <1 % (≈0.1 %)  \n      • Protects 3–5 years; fertility returns quickly.  \n      • Common side effects: irregular bleeding, lighter or no periods, headaches.  \n      • WHO MEC: Category 1 for most women; review medical history (e.g. current breast cancer is Cat 4).  \n   b. Intra-uterine devices (IUDs)  \n      • Copper IUD: 0.8 % typical, 0.6 % perfect; effective 10–12 years.  \n      • LNG-IUD: 0.1 % typical, 0.1 % perfect; effective 5–8 years.  \n      • Side effects: cramping after insertion, heavier periods with copper, lighter periods or spotting with LNG.  \n      • Warning signs (“PAINS”): Period late, Abdominal pain, Infection exposure, Not feeling well/fever, Strings missing—seek care.  \n\n2. Injectable contraceptives\n   • DMPA (3-month) or NET-EN (2-month)  \n   • Typical: 4 %; Perfect: 0.2 %  \n   • Side effects: irregular bleeding, weight change, delayed return to fertility (≈4–9 months).  \n   • WHO MEC: Cat 1/2 for most; Cat 3/4 for unexplained vaginal bleeding, severe hypertension, current breast cancer.  \n\n3. Combined hormonal methods (pill, patch, vaginal ring)\n   • Typical: 7 %; Perfect: 0.3 %  \n   • Must remember daily/weekly/monthly.  \n   • Non-contraceptive benefits: lighter periods, less cramping, acne improvement.  \n   • MEC Cat 3/4 for smokers ≥35 yrs, migraine with aura, severe hypertension, breastfeeding <6 w postpartum.\n\n4. Progestin-only pills (POPs)\n   • Typical: 7 %; Perfect: 0.3 %  \n   • Safe while breastfeeding (Cat 1 ≥6 w postpartum). Must take at the same time every day.  \n\n5. Barrier methods\n   • Male condom: 13 % typical, 2 % perfect.  \n   • Female condom: 21 % typical, 5 % perfect.  \n   • Provide STI/HIV protection; widely available and low-cost/free in Rwanda.  \n\n6. Fertility awareness-based methods (e.g., Standard Days, TwoDay, Symptothermal)\n   • Typical: 2–23 %; depends on user training and cycle regularity.  \n   • No side effects; require partner cooperation and abstaining or condoms on fertile days.  \n\n7. Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)\n   • <2 % up to 6 months postpartum IF fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic, and baby <6 months.  \n   • Switch to another method immediately if any criterion changes.\n\n8. Permanent methods\n   • Female sterilization (tubal ligation): 0.5 %.  \n   • Vasectomy: 0.15 %.  \n   • Intended to be irreversible; must be absolutely sure about ending fertility.\n\nKey factors to consider (Balanced Counseling):\n• Desired family size and timing of next pregnancy  \n• Need for privacy or partner involvement  \n• Comfort with hormones or bleeding changes  \n• Ease of use and follow-up visits  \n• Protection against STIs/HIV (only condoms provide this)\n\nSafety check (WHO MEC):\nMost healthy women (Category 1) can use any method except where specific contraindications exist. If you have:  \n• High blood pressure ≥160/100 mmHg (CHC = Cat 4)  \n• Migraine with aura (CHC = Cat 4, POP = Cat 2)  \n• Current breast cancer (all hormonal methods = Cat 4)  \n…you will need individualized counseling.\n\nWhen to seek care immediately:\n• Heavy vaginal bleeding, severe lower-abdominal pain, severe headaches, chest pain or shortness of breath, jaundice, signs of infection after procedure, or positive pregnancy test while using a method.\n\nCost and access in Rwanda (2021 FP Policy):\n• Public facilities offer most methods free or at low cost.  \n• Adolescents and unmarried clients can receive services without parental or partner consent.  \n• Confidentiality is protected.\n\nNext steps\n1.

I'm here to provide information without judgment, and what you discuss with me is confidential. Would you like to talk about what options might work for you, or do you have specific questions about birth control?",
      "model_response": "It is completely normal to wonder about contraception at your age. Whether you “should” use birth control depends on YOUR own situation—especially whether you are, or might soon become, sexually active—and on your personal goals and values. Below is information to help you make an informed choice. You never have to decide right away, and you can always talk privately with a trained health-care provider for more tailored guidance.\n\n1. First think about your goals\n• Do you want to avoid pregnancy now? If yes, a contraceptive method can help.\n• Are you abstinent and planning to stay that way for now? Then you may not need a method, but it is still useful to know your options in case things change.\n• Do you also want protection from HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? If so, male or female/external condoms are the only methods that protect against STIs, though you can use them together with another (more effective) method—this is called dual protection.\n\n2. Your rights as an adolescent in Rwanda\n• You have the right to confidential family-planning services without needing a parent’s or partner’s consent (Rwanda National FP Policy, 2021).\n• Public health facilities should provide contraception free or at very low cost.\n• Health‐care workers must respect your privacy and treat you without judgment.\n\n3. How effective are the methods?\nEffectiveness is usually expressed as unintended pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of “typical use” (how people usually use it) vs. “perfect use” (correct and consistent use every time).\n\nHighly effective (long-acting reversible contraception, LARC)\n• Implants (e.g., Jadelle, Implanon-NXT)\n  – Typical & perfect use: <1 pregnancy per 100 women in a year (>99% effective)\n  – Protection: 3–5 years, quickly reversible\n• Copper IUD\n  – Typical & perfect use: <1 pregnancy (>99% effective)\n  – Protection: up to 10–12 years, hormone-free\n• Levonorgestrel IUD (where available)\n  – Typical & perfect use: <1 pregnancy (>99% effective)\n  \nVery effective (user-action every 1–3 months)\n• Injectable DMPA (every 3 months)\n  – Typical use: ~4 pregnancies/100 (96% effective)\n  – Perfect use: <1 pregnancy/100 (>99% effective)\n\nEffective if used correctly (requires daily, weekly, or on-time action)\n• Combined oral pills\n  – Typical use: ~7 pregnancies/100 (93% effective)\n  – Perfect use: <1 pregnancy/100 (>99% effective)\n• Progestogen-only pill\n  – Similar effectiveness to combined pill\n• Contraceptive patch or vaginal ring (where available)\n  – Similar to pills\n\nModerately effective / Barrier methods\n• Male (external) condoms\n  – Typical use: ~13 pregnancies/100 (87% effective)\n  – Perfect use: 2 pregnancies/100 (98% effective)\n  – Also prevent STIs/HIV\n• Female (internal) condoms\n  – Typical use: ~21 pregnancies/100 (79% effective)\n• Diaphragm with spermicide (less commonly available)\n  – Typical use: ~17 pregnancies/100 (83% effective)\n\nLess effective\n• Fertility awareness methods (calendar, Standard Days, basal body temperature, etc.)\n  – Typical use: 12–24 pregnancies/100 (76–88% effective)\n• Withdrawal\n  – Typical use: ~20 pregnancies/100 (80% effective)\n\nEmergency contraception\n• Levonorgestrel pills (within 72 h, earlier is better)\n  – Reduce risk of pregnancy by 59–95%\n• Copper IUD inserted within 5 days is the most effective EC (<1% failure) and then can serve as ongoing contraception.\n\n4. Safety for adolescents (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria, 2022)\nMost healthy teenagers are medically eligible (MEC Category 1) for all modern methods, including implants, IUDs, pills, injectables, and condoms. Exceptions exist if you have certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, migraine with aura, severe liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, etc.). A provider will screen you for these.\n\n5. Possible side-effects & warning signs\nThe following are NORMAL and usually improve after a few months:\n• Implants/IUD: irregular bleeding or lighter periods\n• Injectables: irregular bleeding or no monthly bleeding; modest weight change\n• Combined pills/patch/ring: mild nausea, breast tenderness, light spotting\n\nSeek care promptly if you notice:\n• Severe abdominal pain, chest pain, severe headache with visual changes (pills/patch/ring: may signal clot)\n• Fever or pelvic pain after IUD insertion\n• Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking >2 pads/hour for 2 hours)\n• Any sign of infection at an implant or injection site\n• Condom breaks or slips—use emergency contraception\n\n6.

Clarify your needs (pregnancy prevention only or also STI/HIV protection, frequency of sex, ability to remember daily/weekly actions, comfort with clinic procedures).\nb. Review a short list of methods that fit your medical eligibility and preferences.\nc. Discuss each method’s advantages, disadvantages, side effects, and warning signs.\nd. Let YOU decide; the counselor’s role is to support, not pressure.\ne. Plan for follow-up and method switching if needed.\n\n7. Practical tips\n• Dual protection: combine condoms with a highly effective method whenever possible.\n• Confidentiality: You can ask the provider about discreet packaging or timing of visits.\n• Return anytime: if you experience bothersome side effects, want to switch, or think you might be pregnant.\n• STI testing: advisable if you have had unprotected sex or multiple partners.\n\n8. Next steps\n• Reflect on whether you might become sexually active soon and how strongly you want to avoid pregnancy.\n• If you think contraception may be right for you, visit a youth-friendly clinic, health post, or community health worker. You do NOT need parental permission.\n• Prepare to discuss any health conditions or medicines you use.\n• If you decide not to start a method now, that is okay. You can come back whenever you wish.\n\nRemember, the decision is yours. Whatever you choose, you deserve accurate information, respectful care, and support.",

      "ground_truth": "I understand your concern. Can I ask what's making you feel like your body needs a break? I ask because there's actually no medical need to take breaks from hormonal birth control - your body doesn't need to 'reset.' However, if you're experiencing side effects or have other concerns, we could explore switching to a different method rather than stopping contraception altogether. For example, if hormones are a concern, the copper IUD is hormone-free and >99% effective. Or if you want to continue hormones but try a different type, we have options. What specific concerns do you have about your current method? Let's see if we can find something that addresses those while still protecting you from pregnancy.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  Let’s look at your situation step-by-step so you can choose what feels best for you and still avoid an unintended pregnancy.\n\n1.  Clarify your needs  \n• Do you have any side-effects or health concerns with your current method, or do you mainly wish to rest from hormones?  \n• How important is very high effectiveness to you (for example, <1 pregnancy per 100 women in a year)?  \n• Would you prefer something you can forget about for years, something you use only when you have sex, or something in between?  \n• Do you have any medical conditions or take any medicines?  \nThese answers help narrow the safest, most convenient options for you.\n\n2.  Evidence on “taking a break” from hormonal contraception  \nWHO states that healthy users do not need a hormone-free break for medical reasons; fertility, bone health, and future pregnancy outcomes are not harmed by continued use.  \nHowever, it is always your right to pause or switch methods, and many women do so for personal comfort.\n\n3.  Non-hormonal (or very low hormone) options you could consider  \nBelow are the main choices, with typical-use pregnancy rates (what happens in real life) and perfect-use rates (when used exactly as directed), drawn from WHO data.  MEC category is 1 for almost all healthy women unless otherwise noted.\n\nLong-acting reversible contraception (LARC)\n• Copper IUD (Cu-T 380A or similar)  \n  – Effectiveness: Typical 0.8%, Perfect 0.6% (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 women in a year)  \n  – Works up to 10–12 years; can be removed any time and fertility returns quickly.  \n  – Possible changes: Heavier or longer periods, more cramps in the first months.  \n  – Warning signs (PAINS): Period late/abnormal, Abdominal pain, Infection exposure or unusual discharge, Not feeling well/fever, Strings missing or longer/shorter. Seek care if these occur.  \n  – No hormones, so it meets your wish for a “break.”\n\n• Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUS)  \n  – Hormonal but very low dose, mostly local.  \n  – Effectiveness: Typical & Perfect <1%.  \n  – Often makes periods lighter or may stop them (this is safe).  \n\nShort-acting, on-demand, or behavioral methods  \n• Male condoms  \n  – Effectiveness: Typical 13%, Perfect 2%.  \n  – Also protect against HIV and other STIs.  \n  – Need to use every act of sex; may be combined with another method (e.g., withdrawal or fertility awareness) to increase protection.\n\n• Female condom  \n  – Typical 21%, Perfect 5%.  \n\n• Diaphragm with spermicide (if available)  \n  – Typical 17%, Perfect 6%.  \n\n• Fertility Awareness-Based Methods (FABMs)  \n  – Standard Days Method (cycle 26–32 days): Typical 12%, Perfect 5%.  \n  – TwoDay/Cervical mucus, Basal Body Temperature, Symptothermal have similar or slightly lower rates with perfect use.  \n  – Require daily monitoring and partner cooperation; higher failure if cycles are irregular.\n\n• Withdrawal  \n  – Typical 20%, Perfect 4%.  Less reliable, no STI protection.\n\n• Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) – only for women <6 months postpartum, fully/near-fully breastfeeding, and still amenorrheic; typical 2%.\n\nEmergency back-up  \nRegardless of the method you choose, you can always use emergency contraception (EC) after unprotected sex:  \n• Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg up to 120 hrs (best within 72 hrs) – MEC 1.  \n• Copper IUD as EC within 5 days – most effective.\n\n4.  Switching safely  \nIf you stop a hormonal method:  \n• Pills/patch/ring: Start your new non-hormonal method immediately; use condoms or abstain for 7 days.  \n• Injectable: Fertility may take 9–10 weeks after the last shot to return; start the new method as soon as desired.  \n• Implant/IUD: New method can be started the same day of removal.  \nYour provider can give tailored guidance.\n\n5.  Side-effects and when to seek care  \nEach method has its own normal adjustments.  Most side-effects are not harmful and settle after a few cycles.  Seek medical help if you have:  \n• Severe or persistent pelvic pain, heavy bleeding soaking >2 pads/hour for 2 hrs, fever, foul discharge, or if you think you might be pregnant.  \n• For IUD users, PAINS signs listed above.  \n• For condoms, severe allergy or rash.\n\n6.  Access in Rwanda  \n• All listed methods, including IUDs and condoms, are available in public health facilities and many private clinics.  \n• Family planning services are free or low-cost in public centres.  \n• You do NOT need spousal or parental consent, even if you are an adolescent.  \n• You can request counseling, insertion, or removal at your nearest health centre or through community health workers.\n\n7.  Your next steps  \n1. Reflect on how much pregnancy prevention you need versus how comfortable you are with potential side-effects or user effort.  \n2. If you are leaning toward the copper IUD or another LARC, make an appointment for counseling and, if eligible, same-day insertion.  \n3. If you prefer condoms or FABMs, be sure you and your partner are confident in correct use; consider keeping EC on hand.  \n4. Whatever you choose, remember you can switch again any time.\n\nWould you like to talk more about any of these methods, or about which one might fit best with your lifestyle and health?",

      "scenario": "My friend said the IUD is painful and causes infections. Should I avoid it?",
      "ground_truth": "I'm glad you're asking about this. IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication. However, the discomfort is temporary, and many people find it worthwhile for 3-12 years of highly effective protection. As for infections, modern IUDs have a very low infection risk. There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low. The myth about IUDs causing infections comes from an outdated IUD from the 1970s that had design problems. Today's IUDs are very safe. Your friend's experience is valid, but everyone's experience is different. Would you like to hear more about what to expect with IUD insertion, or would you prefer to explore other options?",
      "model_response": "It is understandable to be concerned when you hear negative stories from friends. Let me share what the evidence from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Rwanda’s National Family Planning Program says about intra-uterine devices (IUDs) so that you can decide for yourself.\n\n1. What is an IUD?\n• Two main types are available in Rwanda:  \n  – Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD)  \n  – Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD or hormonal IUD)\n\n2. Effectiveness\n• Cu-IUD: 99.2 % typical-use effectiveness (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 women in the first year).  \n• LNG-IUD: 99.7 % typical-use effectiveness.  \n• Once placed, they work for 10–12 years (Cu-IUD) or up to 5 years (LNG-IUD) and are immediately reversible.\n\n3. Pain during insertion\n• Most women feel some cramping similar to menstrual pain that lasts a few minutes.  \n• Pain can be reduced by: a light meal beforehand, relaxation techniques, taking ibuprofen 30–60 minutes before, or asking the provider for local anaesthetic.  \n• After insertion, mild cramps or spotting may occur for a few days and usually respond to simple pain medicine.  \n• Severe, worsening pain after placement is uncommon and is a warning sign—seek care promptly.\n\n4. Infection risk\n• The main infection worry is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). According to WHO, the risk is only slightly increased in the first 20 days after insertion and mainly if you already have an untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI) at the time of insertion.  \n• Routine screening or syndromic assessment for STIs before placement and using condoms with new or multiple partners can reduce this risk.  \n• After the first month, the risk of infection is the same as for women without an IUD.\n\n5. Who can safely use an IUD? (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria)\n• Category 1 (no restriction): Most healthy women, including adolescents, nulliparous women, and breastfeeding women ≥4 weeks postpartum.  \n• Category 2 (advantages generally outweigh risks): e.g., heavy menstrual bleeding (Cu-IUD) or risk of STIs (with counselling).  \n• Category 3 or 4 (usually should not use): active PID or chlamydia/gonorrhoea, unexplained vaginal bleeding, cervical or endometrial cancer, postpartum <48 hours (Cu-IUD*), certain uterine abnormalities.  \n(*An LNG-IUD is category 3 <4 weeks postpartum.)\n\nA trained provider will screen you for these conditions.\n\n6. Possible side-effects\nCopper IUD\n• Heavier, longer, or more painful periods in the first 3–6 months (usually improve over time).  \nHormonal IUD\n• Lighter periods; many women have little or no bleeding after 12 months.  \nBoth\n• Cramping in the first few days, occasional spotting.\n\n7. Warning signs—seek care if you experience:\n• Severe or increasing pelvic pain or cramps after the first few days  \n• Foul-smelling vaginal discharge or fever  \n• Missed period or positive pregnancy test  \n• Strings suddenly seem much longer/shorter or you cannot feel them\n\n8. Benefits beyond contraception\n• LNG-IUD reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and cramps, and can treat anaemia.  \n• Cu-IUD can be used as emergency contraception up to 5 days after unprotected sex.\n\n9. Cost and access in Rwanda\n• IUDs are offered free or at minimal cost in public facilities.  \n• Adolescents and unmarried women can obtain them without parental or partner consent. Your privacy is protected.\n\n10. Making your decision\n• If long-term, highly effective, and reversible contraception appeals to you, an IUD may be worth considering.  \n• If you prefer a method with no procedure, want predictable bleeding, or have a high ongoing STI risk and find condom use difficult, you might prefer another method.  \n• You can always have the IUD removed at any time if you are unhappy with it.\n\nNext steps\n• If you are interested, schedule a visit with a trained nurse or doctor. They will review your medical history, rule out pregnancy/STIs, answer any further questions, and insert the IUD if you decide to proceed.  \n• If you remain unsure, you may explore other options such as implants, injectables, pills, condoms, fertility-awareness methods, etc. All are available under Rwanda’s family-planning program.\n\nRemember: the final choice is yours. My role is to provide accurate information so you can choose the method that best fits your life and health goals. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask or discuss further with a health-care provider.",

      "ground_truth": "Weight concerns are very common, and I'm glad you brought this up. Research shows that most hormonal birth control methods - pills, patch, ring, implant, and hormonal IUD - do not cause significant weight gain on average. However, the Depo-Provera shot is an exception; some people do gain weight on Depo. Everyone's body is different, so individual experiences vary. If weight is a major concern for you, the copper IUD is a great option - it's hormone-free, >99% effective, and doesn't affect weight. Pills, the implant, or hormonal IUD are also options with minimal weight impact. Would you like to hear more about these methods?",
      "model_response": "I hear that you’re concerned about possible weight gain from contraception. Many clients share this worry. Below is an overview of what the best-quality evidence (summarised in the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook and MEC) tells us about weight changes with the main methods, along with their effectiveness, common side-effects, and when to seek help. Use this information to decide what feels right for you; you are free to choose, switch, or stop a method at any time.\n\n1. Methods with NO proven effect on weight\n   • Copper IUD  \n     ‑ Effectiveness: >99 % with typical use (≈0.8 pregnancies/100 women in the first year).  \n     ‑ Side-effects: Heavier or longer periods in the first months, cramping.  \n     ‑ Warning signs: Severe lower-abdomen pain, fever, very heavy bleeding, missed period with pregnancy symptoms.  \n   • Barrier methods (male/female condoms, diaphragm), fertility-awareness methods, withdrawal  \n     ‑ No hormonal influence, therefore no weight effect.  \n     ‑ Lower effectiveness (e.g., male condom 87 % typical, 98 % perfect).  \n\n2. Hormonal methods with LITTLE OR NO consistent evidence of weight gain\n   (Some individual users report changes, but studies show no clear overall increase.)\n   • Combined oral pills (COC), progestin-only pills (POP)  \n     ‑ Effectiveness: 93 % typical, >99 % perfect with correct daily use.  \n     ‑ Other side-effects: Nausea, breast tenderness, spotting in first cycles.  \n   • Contraceptive patch and vaginal ring  \n     ‑ Effectiveness: 93 % typical, >99 % perfect.  \n   • Levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD (hormonal IUD)  \n     ‑ Effectiveness: >99 %.  \n     ‑ Some users notice acne or breast tenderness; most do not gain weight.  \n   • Implant (e.g., Jadelle®, Implanon NXT®)  \n     ‑ Effectiveness: >99 %.  \n     ‑ Evidence on weight is mixed: average change is small, but a minority gain ≥2–3 kg.  \n\n3. Method MOST often linked to weight gain\n   • DMPA injectable (“Depo-Provera,” every 3 months) and NET-EN (every 2 months)  \n     ‑ Effectiveness: 96 % typical, >99 % perfect when injections are on time.  \n     ‑ Weight: Average gain ≈1–2 kg in the first year; some users gain more.  \n     ‑ Other side-effects: Irregular bleeding, then possible amenorrhoea, delayed return to fertility.  \n\nWhy weight changes differ\n• Hormones can increase appetite, fluid retention, or fat storage in sensitive individuals.  \n• Genetics, diet, physical activity, and life stage also play a role, so experiences vary.\n\nHow you can minimise unwanted weight gain\n• Maintain balanced eating habits and regular physical activity.  \n• Weigh yourself or notice how clothes fit every few months.  \n• If you use injectables and notice rapid gain (>5 kg in 6 months) or it bothers you, you can switch—no waiting period is required.\n\nWhen to seek care\n• Sudden, severe weight gain together with swelling of face/hands/legs, severe headaches, or shortness of breath.  \n• Any severe or persistent side-effect that worries you.\n\nNext steps\n1. Reflect on which features—effectiveness, bleeding pattern, dosing schedule, privacy, and possible weight changes—matter most to you.  \n2. If you would like, schedule a consultation at any public or accredited private facility; in Rwanda, services are free or low-cost, and adolescents or unmarried women can access them without parental or partner consent.  \n3. You can start most methods any time it’s reasonably certain you’re not pregnant (WHO Quick Start).  \n4. Remember: you are in charge. You can try a method and, if it doesn’t suit you, switch to another.\n\nIf you have more questions or want to discuss specific methods in detail, feel free to let me know or talk with a qualified provider.",

What sounds most realistic for your lifestyle? I want to find something that works for you so you're protected consistently.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing your concern.  Forgetting pills is very common, and it can reduce the effectiveness of the method.  Below are some points to help you decide what feels right for you.\n\n1. What happens when pills are missed  \n   • With typical (every-day-life) use, about 7 of every 100 pill-users will become pregnant in the first year (≈ 93 % effective).  \n   • With perfect use (no pills missed), fewer than 1 of every 100 users will become pregnant (≈ 99.7 % effective).  \n   • Missing pills by as little as 24 – 48 hours lowers protection and may require back-up condoms or emergency contraception (EC).  \n\n   If you wish to stay on the pill, you could:  \n   • Set daily phone alarms, use reminder apps, or link pill-taking to a routine (e.g., brushing teeth).  \n   • Keep a spare pack in your bag in case you are away from home.  \n   • Review the missed-pill instructions printed in every packet or ask a provider to demonstrate them again.  \n\n   Remember: If you miss two or more active pills and have unprotected sex, you can use EC (levonorgestrel up to 72 h, ulipristal up to 120 h, or a copper-IUD within 5 days) to lower the chance of pregnancy.\n\n2. You might prefer a method that does not require daily action  \n   All of the following are class-ified as WHO MEC category 1 for healthy, non-breast-feeding women with no contraindications (category 2–4 conditions need individual assessment).  \n\n   Long-acting reversible methods (LARCs) – “fit and forget”  \n   • Hormonal implant (e.g., Jadelle®, Implanon NXT®)  \n     – > 99 % effective (both typical and perfect use)  \n     – Works 3–5 years, can be removed any time  \n     – Common changes: lighter, irregular, or no bleeding; occasional headaches; breast tenderness  \n     – Warning signs: severe arm pain, pus or redness at insertion site (rare)  \n\n   • Copper-bearing IUD  \n     – > 99 % effective for up to 10 years  \n     – Non-hormonal; periods may be heavier or crampier in first months  \n     – Warning signs: severe lower-abdominal pain, foul discharge, fever, or missing strings  \n\n   • Levonorgestrel-IUS (hormonal IUD)  \n     – > 99 % effective for 5–8 years (depending on brand)  \n     – Often causes much lighter or no periods after first months  \n     – Same warning signs as copper IUD  \n\n   Injectable contraceptives  \n   • DMPA (every 3 months) or NET-EN (every 2 months)  \n     – Typical use ≈ 94 % effective; perfect use > 99 %  \n     – Possible weight change, delayed return to fertility (≈ 3–6 months after last dose), irregular bleeding or no bleeding over time  \n     – Warning signs: very heavy bleeding, severe headaches, shortness of breath, or swelling/calves pain (rare)  \n\n   Short-acting options that need action weekly or monthly  \n   • Contraceptive patch (weekly) – 93 % typical, 99 % perfect  \n   • Vaginal ring (monthly) – 93 % typical, 99 % perfect  \n\n3. Side effects and health checks  \n   Most side effects—whether with pills, injectables, implants or IUDs—are not dangerous and often settle after a few months.  Seek care immediately if you notice:  \n   • Severe abdominal or chest pain, sudden shortness of breath  \n   • Severe headaches with vision changes  \n   • Very heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking > 2 pads per hour for several hours)  \n   • Fainting, severe fever, or pus at an insertion site  \n\n4. Accessing services in Rwanda  \n   • All family-planning methods, counseling, and emergency contraception are available free or at low cost in public facilities and many community health posts.  \n   • You do not need partner or parental consent, even if you are an adolescent or unmarried.  \n   • You have the right to respectful, confidential, and non-judgmental care.  \n\n5. Next steps you might consider  \n   • Reflect on which method fits best with your lifestyle and preferences—daily routine, how often you want to think about contraception, menstrual changes you can accept, comfort with procedures, and desired timing of future pregnancy.  \n   • When you are ready, visit the nearest health center or trusted provider.  You can ask to see and hold the various devices, confirm medical eligibility, and have all your questions answered before choosing.  \n   • Bring your partner or a friend if that feels supportive, but the decision is yours.  \n\nIf at any point you feel unsure or experience the warning signs mentioned above, please seek professional medical care promptly.",

      "ground_truth": "I understand there are a lot of options and it can feel overwhelming. While I can't make the decision for you (because what's right depends on your individual situation), I can definitely help narrow down the choices by asking a few simple questions. Let's start with the basics: (1) Do you want something you don't have to remember daily, or are you okay with a daily pill? (2) Do you have any concerns about using hormones? (3) How important is it that you absolutely not get pregnant right now? Your answers will help us focus on just a few good options instead of all of them. Does that sound okay?",
      "model_response": "I understand that choosing a family-planning method can feel overwhelming. Instead of telling you what to use, I’ll guide you—step-by-step—so you can pick the method that best fits your life, health, and preferences. Everything below follows the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+), and Rwanda’s national policy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Let’s Clarify YOUR Needs (you can answer any you’re comfortable with)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• How soon (if at all) would you like to become pregnant in the future—within 1 year, after 2–3 years, 5 years, or never?  \n• Would you prefer something you can forget about for months or years, or something you control each time you have sex?  \n• Do you have any health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, migraines with aura, diabetes, HIV, current breast cancer, etc.)?  \n• Are you breastfeeding a baby under 6 months?  \n• Would your partner’s cooperation matter (e.g., for condoms, withdrawal, fertility-awareness methods)?  \n• How important is discretion (a method no one else can see)?  \n• Are you comfortable with minor procedures (insertion/removal) if they give you long-term protection?  \n• Do monthly visits for refills/injections work for you, or is travel/time off difficult?  \n• Do you also need protection from HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\n\nYour answers will narrow choices and reveal any medical conditions that might make a method unsafe (WHO MEC category 3 or 4) or require extra follow-up (category 2).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Methods Ranked by Effectiveness (Typical Use)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Perfect-use rates are even higher; bold numbers are pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of use.)\n\nTIER 1 – Highest effectiveness  \n• Hormonal implants (e.g., Implanon/Nexplanon, Jadelle): 0.1–0.4 pregnancies (99.6–99.9 % effective)  \n• Copper IUD (non-hormonal): 0.8 pregnancies (99.2 %)  \n• Levonorgestrel (LNG) hormonal IUD (Mirena, etc.): 0.2 pregnancies (99.8 %)  \n• Female sterilization (permanent): 0.5 pregnancies (99.5 %)  \n• Vasectomy (male sterilization): 0.15 pregnancies (99.85 %)\n\nTIER 2 – High effectiveness if used correctly  \n• Injectables (DMPA 3-monthly or NET-EN 2-monthly): 4 pregnancies (96 %)  \n• Combined oral contraceptive pills: 7 pregnancies (93 %)  \n• Progestin-only pills: 7 pregnancies (93 %)  \n• Combined hormonal patch or vaginal ring (where available): 7 pregnancies (93 %)\n\nTIER 3 – Moderate effectiveness  \n• Male condoms: 13 pregnancies (87 %)—also protect against STIs/HIV  \n• Female condoms: 21 pregnancies (79 %)—protect against STIs/HIV  \n• Diaphragm with spermicide: 17 pregnancies (83 %)\n\nTIER 4 – Lower effectiveness, user-dependent  \n• Fertility-awareness-based methods (e.g., Standard Days, TwoDay, Symptothermal): 12–24 pregnancies (76–88 %)  \n• Withdrawal: 20 pregnancies (80 %)  \n• Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM): 2 pregnancies (98 %)—but only valid if baby < 6 months, exclusive breastfeeding, and menses not returned.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Safety Screening Highlights (WHO MEC)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nMost healthy women can safely use any method (MEC 1). Important exceptions:  \n• Combined estrogen methods (pills, patch, ring) are MEC 3/4 if you have: breastfeeding < 6 weeks postpartum, BP ≥160/100 mmHg, migraine with aura, certain clotting disorders, smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day and age ≥35, current breast cancer, etc.  \n• Progestin-only methods (implants, injectable, POPs, LNG-IUD) are generally MEC 1 or 2 for most conditions, but current breast cancer is MEC 4.  \n• Copper IUD is MEC 4 if you have current pelvic infection or unexplained vaginal bleeding, and MEC 3 if you have high risk of STIs or severe anemia.  \nIf any of these might apply, please mention them so a provider can confirm eligibility.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. Key Features, Side Effects, & When to Seek Care\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is a concise overview of the most popular methods in Rwanda. Ask if you want details on any other option.\n\nA. Hormonal Implant (3-5 years)  \n• Small rod in upper arm; quick outpatient procedure.  \n• Side effects: irregular or absent bleeding (common and not harmful), mild headaches, breast tenderness.  \n• Warning signs: Very rare arm infection, severe pain, pregnancy symptoms.  \n• Removal anytime. Fertility returns quickly.\n\nB. Copper IUD (10+ years)  \n• Non-hormonal, inserted in uterus.  \n• Side effects: heavier, longer periods in first months, cramps.  \n• Warning signs (PAINS): Period late, Abnormal pain, Infection exposure, Not feeling well (fever/chills), Strings missing—seek care.\n\nC. Hormonal LNG-IUD (5–7 years)  \n• Lighter periods, some spotting first 3–6 months.  \n• Similar warning signs to copper IUD.\n\nD. 3-Monthly Injectable (DMPA)  \n• Get an injection every 12 weeks.  \n• Side effects: irregular bleeding or no menses, slight weight gain, delayed return of fertility (≈4–10 months after last shot).  \n• Warning signs: severe headaches, heavy bleeding, pus/redness at injection site.\n\nE. Combined Oral Pills  \n• Daily pill at same time.  \n• Side effects: mild nausea, breast tenderness, light spotting first cycles.  \n• Danger signs (ACHES): Abdominal pain, Chest pain, Headache severe, Eye/vision change, Severe leg pain—seek care immediately.\n\nF. Male Condoms  \n• Single use; protect against STIs/HIV.  \n• Side effects: none except rare latex allergy.  \n• Seek care for possible STI if you notice sores, discharge, or pain.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Cost & Access in Rwanda\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Public health facilities and accredited community health workers provide most methods free or at minimal cost.  \n• Adolescents and unmarried clients have the same right to services; parental or partner consent is NOT required.  \n• Confidentiality is respected.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Making Your Decision\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo help you choose, consider:\n\n1. How important is highest possible effectiveness?  \n2. Do you want a method you can stop without a clinic visit?  \n3. Are hormonal side effects acceptable or would you prefer non-hormonal?  \n4. Do you also need STI/HIV protection (condoms can be added to any method)?  \n5. How soon do you plan another pregnancy?\n\nIf you let me know your priorities and any health issues, I can narrow the options further using WHO MEC and explain the short list in more depth.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7. Next Steps\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Write down any questions or concerns.  \n• Visit your nearest health center or community health worker—they will confirm you are medically eligible (MEC screening), provide the method, and give you detailed instructions.  \n• Return or call if you experience danger signs, want to switch methods, or need more supplies.\n\nYou are in control of this decision, and it’s completely okay to try a method and later change it. Let me know what matters most to you, and we’ll go from there.",

Your safety and autonomy are important. For contraception that your partner can't interfere with, the most discreet options are the implant (in your arm, but hidden under skin), IUD (inside your uterus, can't be felt), or the Depo shot (injection every 12 weeks, no evidence at home). Pills, patches, and rings can be found or tampered with. Beyond contraception, I'm concerned about your safety. Are you in a safe situation right now? I can provide information about local domestic violence resources if that would be helpful. You deserve support and safety.",
      "model_response": "I’m sorry you are experiencing this situation. Many people face pressure or interference with their reproductive choices, and there are contraceptive methods that can give you more control and privacy. Let’s review them so you can decide what feels safest and most acceptable to you. Everything below is based on the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the Balanced Counseling Strategy+, and—if you are in Rwanda—the 2021 National Family Planning Policy.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. Long-acting, highly effective methods that can be used without a partner’s knowledge or involvement  \n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Subdermal Implant  \n• What it is: 1–2 small plastic rods placed under the skin of the upper arm.  \n• Effectiveness:  \n  – Typical use: >99% (about 0.1–0.4 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year).  \n  – Perfect use: >99%.  \n• How private? Completely hidden under the skin; only a health-care provider can feel it on close examination. No supplies are kept at home.  \n• Duration: 3–5 years (depending on brand) but removable any time. Fertility returns quickly after removal.  \n• Side-effects: Irregular bleeding or spotting (most common), light or no bleeding, headaches, mood changes, acne. These usually lessen after the first few months.  \n• Warning signs/seek care: Very severe lower-abdominal pain (could indicate ovarian cyst or ectopic pregnancy—rare); signs of infection at insertion site (redness, pus, fever); pregnancy signs.  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1 for most women. Certain conditions (e.g., current breast cancer = Cat 4) require other options, so disclose any serious illness to the provider.  \n• Follow-up: Return any time you wish to remove, if you have side-effects you cannot manage, or if you suspect pregnancy.\n\nB. Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD)  \n• What it is: A small T-shaped device placed in the uterus.  \n• Effectiveness:  \n  – Typical use: >99% (0.6–0.8 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year).  \n  – Perfect use: >99%.  \n• How private? Strings usually rest inside the vagina; a partner generally cannot feel them during sex. Provider can trim strings very short if you are worried about detection.  \n• Duration: 10–12 years (depending on brand) but removable any time. Fertility returns immediately.  \n• Side-effects: Heavier or more painful periods for some users, especially in the first 3–6 months.  \n• Warning signs/seek care: Severe lower-abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, foul discharge, missed period with pregnancy symptoms.  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1 for most women who do not have current pelvic infection, unexplained vaginal bleeding, or certain cancers.  \n• Extra benefit: Can also be used as emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.\n\nC. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD)  \n• What it is: A hormonal T-shaped device placed in the uterus.  \n• Effectiveness: >99% (0.1–0.3 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year).  \n• Duration: 5–8 years (brand-specific).  \n• Privacy, side-effects, warning signs: Similar to Cu-IUD, but periods usually become lighter or stop—many women like this.  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1 for most, Cat 4 for current breast cancer.\n\nD. Injectable contraceptives  \n1. DMPA (3-month) or 2. NET-EN (2-month)  \n• Effectiveness:  \n  – Typical use: ~94 % (6 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year).  \n  – Perfect use: >99%.  \n• Privacy: Single injection in the arm/buttock every 8–12 weeks. No visible marks after a day or two; nothing to store at home.  \n• Side-effects: Irregular bleeding or no bleeding, weight gain, delayed return to fertility (average 4–10 months after last injection), headaches.  \n• Warning signs: Very heavy bleeding, migraine with aura, severe lower-abdominal pain, pregnancy signs.  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1 for most. Current breast cancer = Cat 4. Severe hypertension or unexplained vaginal bleeding = Cat 3.  \n• Follow-up: Return for next injection on time; can switch or stop any time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2. User-controlled methods that are somewhat easier for a partner to notice  \n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThese may still be useful if you feel safe keeping supplies:  \n\n• Oral contraceptive pills (combined or progestin-only) – 93 % typical, >99 % perfect. Must take daily and keep packets.  \n• Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs: levonorgestrel 1.5 mg up to 120 h; or ulipristal 30 mg up to 120 h). Can keep a dose on hand in case of condom tampering or forced sex. Typical effectiveness: 58–95 % depending on timing; earlier is better.  \n• Female condoms or diaphragms – can be inserted yourself, but partner may notice.  \n• Fertility awareness methods or withdrawal – less reliable and often need partner cooperation, so usually not recommended in situations of coercion.  \n• Male condoms – highly effective with perfect use (98 %), but typical use is ~87 % and partner must cooperate.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3. Other considerations\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n• Dual protection against STIs/HIV: If you are at risk, the safest approach is a hidden method (e.g., implant) plus a condom whenever possible.  \n• Pregnancy testing and emergency contraception: Keep a pregnancy test and ECPs where your partner will not find them if you think sabotage occurs.  \n• Future fertility: All WHO-recommended modern methods are reversible except sterilization.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n4. Your safety and well-being\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nReproductive coercion is a form of intimate partner violence.  \n• If you ever feel unsafe, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or a gender-based-violence hotline.  \n• In Rwanda, toll-free hotlines include 3512 (Isange One-Stop Center) and 116 (Child/GBV helpline).  \n• Health-care providers are trained to give confidential support; you can ask to speak privately without your partner present.  \n• You have the legal right in Rwanda to obtain contraception without a partner’s or parent’s consent, and services at public facilities are free or very low-cost.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n5. Next steps\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Think about which features matter most to you: length of protection, ability to keep it hidden, frequency of visits, possible side-effects.  \n2. Visit a clinic or pharmacy when you can go alone or with someone you trust. Let the provider know you are concerned about privacy so they can help choose and place a method discreetly.  \n3. If you have any medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes, migraines, breast issues, recent childbirth, etc.), tell the provider so they can apply the WHO MEC and be sure the method is safe for you.  \n4. Schedule follow-up or removal only when you feel it is safe. Remember—you can switch methods anytime.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n6. Warning signs—seek care immediately if you experience:\n-------------------------------------------------\n• Sudden severe abdominal pain or fainting (possible ectopic pregnancy).  \n• Heavy vaginal bleeding soaking >2 pads/hour for 2 consecutive hours.  \n• Fever or foul discharge after an insertion or injection.  \n• Severe headaches with vision changes (especially if using hormonal methods).  \n• Any suspected pregnancy while on contraception.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nI hope this information helps you feel more in control of your reproductive health. You deserve to make these decisions freely and safely. If anything is unclear or you’d like to discuss more details, please let me know.",

(3) The Depo shot is given every 12 weeks with no supplies at home. Pills, patches, and rings are harder to keep private. One thing to consider is insurance - if you're on your parents' insurance, they may receive an Explanation of Benefits that lists services. Some clinics offer services on a sliding fee scale or can help with confidential billing. Would you like information about confidential clinics in your area?",
      "model_response": "I hear that you would like reliable pregnancy prevention but do not want your parents to know. Let’s go through your choices in a confidential, non-judgmental way so you can decide what works best for you. Everything below is based on the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+) and, in case you are in Rwanda, the 2021 National FP Policy (which allows adolescents to obtain family-planning services without parental consent and at low or no cost in public facilities).\n\n1. How private can services be?\n• Health-care workers are required to keep your visit confidential. You may attend alone or with someone you trust.  \n• In Rwanda, you can receive any modern contraceptive method (including implants and IUDs) without showing an ID, without a guardian, and free or at minimal cost in public facilities.  \n• You can ask the provider to note only the minimum information in your file and to avoid calling or texting you if you prefer.\n\n2. Discreet methods you control\nBelow are methods that leave little or no evidence at home once provided. All are WHO MEC category 1 for healthy adolescents.\n\nA. Hormonal implant (e.g. Jadelle, Implanon)\n   • What it is: 1–2 small rods placed under the skin of the upper arm; lasts 3–5 years.  \n   • Effectiveness: <1 pregnancy per 100 users in the first year (typical and perfect use ≃ 0.1%).  \n   • Privacy: Totally hidden; only a small bump that you can feel. No supplies to store.  \n   • Common side-effects: Irregular bleeding or no periods, mild headache, breast tenderness.  \n   • Warning signs (rare): Heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, pus/redness at insertion site—seek care.  \n   • Removal: Can be taken out at any time if you change your mind; fertility returns quickly.\n\nB. Intrauterine device (IUD)\n   1. Copper T 380A (non-hormonal, 10+ years)  \n   2. LNG-IUS (hormonal, 5 years)  \n   • Effectiveness: 0.8% (Copper) or 0.2% (LNG-IUS) typical use.  \n   • Privacy: Nothing to see externally; only you and the provider know.  \n   • Side-effects: Copper—heavier periods in first months; LNG-IUS—lighter or no periods.  \n   • Warning signs: Pelvic pain, fever, foul discharge, missed period with pregnancy symptoms—seek care.  \n   • Needs pelvic insertion by a trained provider; you can ask for a female provider if that is more comfortable.\n\nC. Injectable contraceptive (e.g. Depo-Provera, Sayana Press)\n   • Given every 3 months (DMPA) or every 2 months (NET-EN).  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use ≈ 4 pregnancies/100 women per year; correct-time injections ≈ 0.2%.  \n   • Privacy: No supplies at home; a brief clinic visit or self-injection option (Sayana Press) that you can keep privately.  \n   • Side-effects: Irregular bleeding or no periods, weight change, delayed return of fertility (4–10 months on average).  \n   • Warning signs: Severe headaches, heavy bleeding, swelling/redness where injected—seek care.\n\nD. Progestin-only pills (POPs) or combined oral pills (COCs)\n   • Taken daily at the same time.  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use 7 pregnancies/100 women per year; perfect use ≈ 0.3%.  \n   • Privacy: Packets may be found; you decide if that is acceptable.  \n   • Side-effects: Nausea (often improves), spotting, breast tenderness.  \n   • Warning signs: Severe chest pain, migraines with aura, leg swelling (mostly COCs).  \n   • If living with parents, think about hiding/storing the packet and silent phone reminders.\n\nE. Emergency contraception (EC)\n   • 1.5 mg levonorgestrel pill(s) within 120 hours of unprotected sex; sooner is better.  \n   • Prevents 52–95 % of expected pregnancies depending on timing.  \n   • Does not affect ongoing fertility; can be used more than once, but is not a regular method.  \n   • Available over the counter in many countries; keep receipt and packaging private if needed.\n\nF. Condoms (male or female)\n   • Effectiveness: Male—typical 13%, perfect 2%; Female—typical 21%, perfect 5%.  \n   • Added benefit of STI/HIV prevention.  \n   • Packets are visible, but you can carry a few discreetly.  \n   • Side-effects: None, unless latex allergy (latex-free versions exist).  \n\n3. How to choose?\n• Think about what matters most: privacy, how often you want to think about contraception, menstrual changes, and protection from STIs/HIV.  \n• Many people combine methods (e.g., implant + condom) for extra protection and STI prevention.  \n• You have the right to start, switch, or stop any method at any time.\n\n4. Practical tips for keeping contraceptive use private\n• Schedule clinic visits during school breaks or times your parents expect you to be elsewhere.  \n• Ask the clinic not to stamp your health booklet with the method name, or to write acronyms only.  \n• For injectables or implants, wear clothing that covers the upper arm on the day of insertion.  \n• Store pills or condoms in a private pouch, phone case, or trusted friend’s place if needed.  \n• Use a phone app with a neutral icon or set silent alarms for reminders.  \n\n5. When to return to the clinic or seek care urgently\n• Any severe abdominal or pelvic pain, heavy or prolonged bleeding, fever with pelvic pain, or if you suspect pregnancy.  \n• For hormonal methods: sudden severe headache, chest pain, trouble breathing, leg pain.  \n• If a condom breaks, consider EC within 5 days.\n\n6. Next steps\nIf you feel ready, visit a nearby health center, youth corner, pharmacy, or community health worker. You can simply say you want family-planning services; no one should require your parents’ approval. The provider will review your medical history to confirm eligibility (MEC category) and will help you start the method you choose.\n\nRemember, you are in control of your reproductive health. If you have further questions or concerns, feel free to ask or speak confidentially with a trained health-care provider.",

      "scenario": "I heard IUDs can make you infertile. Is that true?",
      "ground_truth": "No, that's a common myth but it's not true. IUDs do not cause infertility. Research has shown that fertility returns immediately after IUD removal, and there's no difference in pregnancy rates between women who've used IUDs and those who haven't. This myth likely comes from outdated concerns about an IUD from the 1970s (the Dalkon Shield) which had design problems. Modern IUDs are very safe and don't affect your future fertility at all. Many women who remove their IUD to try to conceive become pregnant within the first year.",
      "model_response": "I’m glad you asked—there are many myths about IUDs (intra-uterine devices) and infertility. Here is what the evidence from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook and Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) tells us.  \n\n1. Do IUDs cause infertility?  \n• No. Large, well-designed studies have found no link between modern IUD use (either copper-bearing or hormonal/levonorgestrel) and future infertility.  \n• Fertility returns quickly after removal. In most studies, about 80 – 90 % of women who want to become pregnant conceive within 12 months of IUD removal—similar to women who never used an IUD.\n\n2. Where did the myth come from?  \n• Decades ago, an older IUD model (the Dalkon Shield, no longer on the market) was associated with pelvic infections and infertility. Today’s IUDs are designed differently and are safe.  \n• Any untreated sexually transmitted infection (STI) can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and, rarely, infertility—whether or not a woman uses an IUD. To minimise this risk, providers screen for STI symptoms before inserting the IUD and use clean/aseptic technique.\n\n3. How effective are IUDs?  \nTypical-use pregnancy rates (first year of use):  \n• Copper-bearing IUD: about 8 pregnancies per 1,000 women (0.8 %).  \n• Levonorgestrel (hormonal) IUD: about 1 pregnancy per 1,000 women (0.1 %).  \nPerfect-use rates are slightly lower.\n\n4. Who can use an IUD? (WHO MEC)  \n• Category 1 (no restriction) or 2 (advantages generally outweigh risks) for most women, including adolescents and women who have not yet had a child.  \n• Your provider will ask about certain conditions (e.g., current pelvic infection, certain cancers, unexplained vaginal bleeding) that may place you in Category 3 or 4 (not usually recommended).\n\n5. Common side-effects (not harmful but worth knowing)  \nCopper IUD:  \n• Heavier or longer periods, more cramps—often improve after the first few months.  \nHormonal (LNG) IUD:  \n• Lighter periods, spotting, or no bleeding at all after several months.  \nMost side-effects lessen with time; if they bother you, seek advice rather than simply discontinuing.\n\n6. Warning signs—when to seek care (remember the acronym “PAINS”)  \nP—Period late (possible pregnancy) or very irregular after being regular  \nA—Abdominal pain or pain with intercourse  \nI—Infection signs: unusual vaginal discharge, fever, chills  \nN—Not feeling well, strong cramping, or severe fatigue  \nS—Strings missing, shorter, or longer than before (may indicate expulsion)  \nIf any of these occur, visit a health facility promptly.\n\n7. Cost and access in Rwanda  \n• IUD services are free or low-cost in public facilities.  \n• Adolescents and unmarried women can obtain an IUD without parental or partner consent, and services should be provided in a confidential, respectful manner.\n\n8. Your next steps  \n• If you are interested in an IUD, a trained provider will review your medical history, examine you as needed, and insert the device during a brief visit.  \n• If an IUD isn’t your preference, many other highly effective methods are available. You have the right to choose what feels best for you.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions or discuss any concerns—your decision will be respected, and comprehensive information is always available.",

      "ground_truth": "No, you don't need to take a break from the pill. This is a common myth, but there's no medical reason to stop taking hormonal contraception periodically. Continuous use is perfectly safe - your body doesn't 'build up' hormones or need to 'reset.' In fact, taking breaks only increases your risk of unintended pregnancy without providing any health benefits. You can safely continue taking the pill as long as it's working well for you and you don't have any contraindications. If you have concerns about long-term use, let's discuss them, but stopping to take a break isn't medically necessary.",
      "model_response": "Here is the information you requested.  If anything is unclear, please feel free to ask more questions or talk with a qualified provider.  \n\n1. Do users of the pill need routine “breaks”?  \n   • According to the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) there is no medical reason to stop combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or progestin-only pills (POPs) after a certain number of years if you remain medically eligible (MEC category 1 or 2).  \n   • Taking a “pill holiday” does not improve future fertility, reduce side-effects long-term, or make the method safer. If you stop the pill, your fertility returns quickly—often within a few days to a few weeks—so pregnancy can occur unless another effective method is used.\n\n2. Effectiveness  \n   • Typical use (how most people use it): about 93 % effective (7 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year).  \n   • Perfect use (taken exactly as directed every day): more than 99 % effective (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 users in the first year).\n\n3. Ongoing safety checks  \n   You can usually continue using the pill up to menopause (around age 50) if:  \n   • Your blood pressure remains below 140/90 mm Hg.  \n   • You do not start smoking (or you smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day and are under 35).  \n   • You do not develop migraine with aura, unexplained vaginal bleeding, blood-clot problems, severe liver disease, or other conditions that would shift you to MEC category 3 or 4.  \n   A yearly visit (or any time you notice changes) to check blood pressure and discuss new health issues is recommended.\n\n4. Common side-effects (often settle after the first few cycles)  \n   • Nausea, mild headaches, breast tenderness, lighter or irregular bleeding, slight weight change, mood changes.  \n   • You do NOT have to stop for these unless they bother you and you prefer a different method.\n\n5. Warning signs—seek care urgently if you notice:  \n   • Severe abdominal pain, severe chest pain or shortness of breath, severe sudden headache or migraine with aura, sudden vision change, severe leg pain or swelling.  \n   • These could indicate a rare but serious complication such as a blood clot.\n\n6. If you are thinking of stopping anyway  \n   • Be sure you have another reliable method in place first if you wish to avoid pregnancy.  \n   • Fertility returns quickly, so even a short break can lead to pregnancy.\n\n7. Rwanda-specific notes  \n   • Family-planning services are available free or at low cost in public facilities.  \n   • No parental or partner consent is required, and all women and adolescents have equal access.  \n   • If you prefer switching methods (implants, injectables, IUDs, condoms, etc.), you can request this at any health centre.\n\n8. Your next steps  \n   • If you are happy with the pill and have no new health issues, you may safely continue—no break is needed.  \n   • If you have concerns about side-effects, cost, remembering pills, or new health conditions, schedule a visit to review options.  \n   • At any time, you are free to switch methods, continue, or stop—the choice is yours.\n\nI hope this clarifies things. If anything feels unclear or you notice changes in your health, please consult a healthcare provider.",

      "ground_truth": "No, emergency contraception is not abortion - it prevents pregnancy from happening in the first place. Emergency contraception works by preventing or delaying ovulation (the release of an egg) or by preventing fertilization. If you're already pregnant, emergency contraception won't work and won't harm an existing pregnancy. Abortion, on the other hand, ends an existing pregnancy. Emergency contraception must be taken before pregnancy occurs to be effective. This is an important distinction based on how emergency contraception actually works in the body.",
      "model_response": "I understand why the two ideas can sound similar, but according to the World Health Organization (WHO) they are quite different.\n\n1. When does pregnancy begin?  \n   • WHO defines pregnancy as starting only after a fertilized egg has implanted in the lining of the uterus (usually about 6–12 days after intercourse).  \n   • Anything that works before implantation is contraception, not abortion.\n\n2. How does emergency contraception (EC) work?  \n   • Levonorgestrel pills (e.g., Postinor-2, NorLevo) and ulipristal acetate pills delay or block ovulation, so no egg is released for sperm to meet.  \n   • The copper-bearing IUD harms sperm and prevents fertilization.  \n   • EC does not disturb an already-implanted pregnancy, does not harm an embryo, and will not cause an abortion.  \n   • If a person is already pregnant, EC pills simply have no effect.\n\n3. Effectiveness (WHO 2022 figures)  \n   • Copper IUD used as EC: >99 % effective; <1 pregnancy per 100 women.  \n   • Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg taken within 72 h: about 98 % perfect-use effectiveness (1–2 pregnancies per 100 women); effectiveness declines as the hours pass but still offers some protection up to 120 h.  \n   • Ulipristal 30 mg up to 120 h: 98–99 % perfect-use effectiveness.  \n   • Typical-use effectiveness is slightly lower because of delays in taking the pills.\n\n4. WHO Medical Eligibility Category  \n   • EC pills and copper IUD for emergency use are MEC Category 1 (safe for all women and adolescents, including those who have never given birth).\n\n5. Side-effects and warning signs  \n   • EC pills: possible temporary nausea, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness, or earlier/later next period. These are short-lived and not dangerous.  \n   • Copper IUD: cramping or light bleeding in the first days; heavier periods and more cramps for some users.  \n   • Seek care if severe lower-abdominal pain occurs (could be ectopic pregnancy or IUD perforation, both rare).\n\n6. Service access in Rwanda  \n   • Adolescents and unmarried women have the right to obtain EC without parental or partner consent (Rwanda FP Policy 2021).  \n   • EC pills are available at public facilities and many pharmacies at low or no cost; the copper IUD can be provided at health centers and district hospitals.\n\n7. Key take-home message  \n   • Emergency contraception helps prevent a pregnancy before it begins.  \n   • Abortion ends an established pregnancy after implantation.  \n   • Therefore, EC is not the same as abortion. Choosing EC is a safe, legal, and acceptable way to reduce the chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex, contraceptive failure, or sexual assault.\n\nIf you have more questions or need help choosing the best method for you, a trained health-care provider or family planning counselor in Rwanda can offer confidential, non-judgmental support.",

      "ground_truth": "The relationship between birth control pills and cancer is more complex than a simple yes or no. Research shows that while the pill may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, this risk returns to normal about 10 years after stopping. However, the pill significantly decreases the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial (uterine) cancer - and this protection lasts for years after stopping the pill.

      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing your concern. It is common to hear mixed messages about oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), and it is good to look for accurate information before deciding.\n\n1. What do we know from the World Health Organization (WHO)?\n   • WHO reviews a very large amount of research every few years.  \n   • Current evidence shows that combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and progestin-only pills (POPs) do NOT increase overall cancer deaths.  \n   • While a woman is USING COCs, there is:\n       – A small increase in the chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer or cervical cancer. This increased risk gradually disappears within a few years after stopping the pills.  \n   • There is a DECREASE in the risk of endometrial (uterine), ovarian, and colorectal cancers—and the protection lasts for years after stopping the pills.  \n   • For most healthy women the balance of benefits and possible risks still favors pill use, but every person is different.\n\n2. WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC)\n   • Most women fall into MEC category 1 or 2 for OCPs, meaning the method can generally be used safely.  \n   • Certain conditions (for example, current breast cancer = MEC 4, or some types of migraine = MEC 3) would make pills unsuitable or require closer medical evaluation. A health-care provider can screen for these conditions.\n\n3. How effective are the pills?\n   • Typical use: about 93 % effective (7 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).  \n   • Perfect use: >99 % effective (0.3 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).  \n   • Effectiveness depends on taking a pill every day at roughly the same time.\n\n4. Common side-effects (usually mild and often improve in 2–3 months)\n   • Irregular spotting or light bleeding  \n   • Breast tenderness  \n   • Nausea or mild headaches  \n   • Mild weight change or mood change (less common)\n\n5. Warning signs—seek care promptly if you notice (ACHES):\n   • A – severe Abdominal pain  \n   • C – Chest pain or shortness of breath  \n   • H – severe Headache, dizziness, or weakness  \n   • E – Eye problems (blurring, loss of vision)  \n   • S – Severe leg pain or swelling\n\n   These could indicate a rare but serious complication such as blood clots.\n\n6. When to return or seek help\n   • If you experience any of the warning signs above, or think you might be pregnant, or find it hard to take the pill every day.  \n   • Routine check-up at least once a year, or sooner if you have concerns.\n\n7. Your autonomy and next steps\n   • In Rwanda, you can choose any family planning method—even as an adolescent—without parental consent, and services are free or low-cost in public facilities.  \n   • If you prefer a method with no daily action, you might also consider injectables, implants, IUDs, or other options. A provider can help compare them.\n\nIn summary: Current, high-quality studies reviewed by WHO show that oral contraceptive pills do not cause a general increase in cancer overall. There is a temporary rise in breast and cervical cancer risk while using pills, but also long-term protection against some other cancers. If you have specific health conditions or worries, it is best to talk with a trained health-care provider, who can review your personal history and help you decide whether pills—or another method—fit your needs and preferences.\n\nPlease let me know if you’d like more details or to discuss other family planning methods.",

      "ground_truth": "Breastfeeding can help prevent pregnancy, but only under very specific conditions called the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM). LAM is about 98% effective if ALL three of these are true: (1) You're exclusively or nearly-exclusively breastfeeding (no formula, no solids), (2) Your baby is less than 6 months old, and (3) Your period hasn't returned. If any of these don't apply to you, you can get pregnant while breastfeeding. Many people prefer to use an additional method for extra protection. Progestin-only pills, the implant, IUD, or Depo shot are all safe while breastfeeding.",
      "model_response": "I understand why people often think breastfeeding alone will keep them from getting pregnant. Breastfeeding does reduce fertility, but it is only a reliable contraceptive under very specific conditions. Let’s review what the World Health Organization (WHO) and Rwanda’s National Family Planning Policy say, and then look at your options so you can decide what feels right for you.\n\n1. How breastfeeding prevents pregnancy (LAM – Lactational Amenorrhoea Method)\n   • Criteria for LAM to work:\n     – Your baby is less than 6 months old, AND\n     – You have had no vaginal bleeding after day 56 postpartum (no return of menses), AND\n     – You are breastfeeding on demand, day and night, with no long gaps (exclusive or almost-exclusive breastfeeding: the baby receives little or no other food or liquids).\n   • Effectiveness:\n     – Perfect/correct use: about 98% effective.\n     – Typical use (real-life): about 92–98% effective. Once any one of the three conditions changes, protection drops quickly.\n   • What this means: If your baby is older than 6 months, you have started menstruating again, or you are supplementing feeds, you could become pregnant—even if you are still breastfeeding often.\n\n2. Options for additional or back-up contraception while breastfeeding\n   (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria categories for a breastfeeding woman are shown in brackets.)\n\n   NON-HORMONAL\n   • Male or female condoms (MEC 1; anytime)  \n     Typical effectiveness 88% (male), 79% (female); perfect use 98%–95%.  \n     Added benefit: protection from STIs, including HIV.\n   • Copper IUD  \n     – Within 10 minutes after placental delivery: MEC 1 (immediate postpartum).  \n     – After 48 h up to <4 weeks: MEC 3 (generally not recommended).  \n     – ≥4 weeks postpartum: MEC 1.  \n     Effectiveness >99% typical and perfect use.  \n     Can stay in for up to 12 years but removable any time.\n   • Permanent methods (female or male sterilisation) – MEC 1 (if you are absolutely sure you want no more children).\n\n   PROGESTIN-ONLY (safe for breastfeeding)\n   • Implants (e.g., levonorgestrel, etonogestrel)  \n     – <6 weeks postpartum: MEC 2  \n     – ≥6 weeks: MEC 1  \n     Effectiveness >99% typical and perfect use; lasts 3–5 years, reversible immediately.\n   • Progestin-only injectables (DMPA/NET-EN)  \n     – <6 weeks postpartum: MEC 3  \n     – 6 weeks–6 months: MEC 1  \n     – After 6 months: MEC 1  \n     Effectiveness 96% typical, >99% perfect; injection every 3 months (DMPA) or 2 months (NET-EN).\n   • Progestin-only pills (POPs)  \n     – <6 weeks postpartum: MEC 2  \n     – ≥6 weeks: MEC 1  \n     Effectiveness 93% typical, >99% perfect; must take at the same time each day.\n\n   COMBINED ESTROGEN–PROGESTIN METHODS (pills, ring, patch)\n   • Contain estrogen, which can slightly reduce milk supply in early postpartum.  \n   • <6 weeks postpartum and breastfeeding: MEC 4 (unacceptable risk).  \n   • 6 weeks–6 months, fully or nearly fully breastfeeding: MEC 3 (usually not recommended).  \n   • ≥6 months postpartum: MEC 2 (benefits generally outweigh risks).  \n   Typical effectiveness 93%; perfect use >99%.\n\n   EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION\n   • 1.5 mg levonorgestrel pill (MEC 1 while breastfeeding).  \n   • Cu-IUD inserted ≤5 days after unprotected sex (MEC 1 if ≥4 weeks postpartum; MEC 3 if 48 h–<4 weeks).\n\n3. How to choose\n   • Think about how long you want to avoid pregnancy, how comfortable you feel with daily vs. long-acting methods, whether you want hormones, and whether STI prevention is also important.  \n   • In Rwanda you have the right to choose any method, free or at low cost in public facilities, even if you are not married or are an adolescent. No parental or partner consent is legally required.\n\n4. Possible side-effects & warning signs\n   (Brief examples; your provider will give full information.)\n   • Progestin-only: irregular bleeding or no periods, mild weight change, headaches.  \n   • Injectables: delayed return to fertility (about 3–12 months after last shot).  \n   • IUD: cramping or heavier periods (copper), lighter bleeding or spotting (hormonal IUS).  \n   • Implants: irregular bleeding patterns.  \n   • Warning signs (“return immediately”): severe abdominal pain, heavy or prolonged bleeding, fever/chills, pus or severe pain at insertion site, signs of pregnancy.\n\n5. When to start\n   • Most methods can be started immediately if LAM criteria are not met, or any time you wish extra protection—even if you are still amenorrheic.  \n   • If you are still within LAM criteria but want additional security, you may start any method that is MEC 1 or 2 for your postpartum time frame without stopping breastfeeding.\n\n6. Follow-up and supplies\n   • Schedule a post-partum or family-planning visit at your nearest health centre or with a community health worker (CHW). Services are confidential and usually free.  \n   • Take your child’s immunisation visit as an opportunity to discuss contraception, or request home visits from a CHW if more convenient.\n\nKey message\nBreastfeeding gives good—but not absolute—protection against pregnancy only for the first 6 months and only if you have no bleeding and are feeding frequently enough. If any of those change, you can become pregnant. Adding a modern family-planning method will give you much higher, year-round protection.

      "scenario": "If I douche right after sex, will that prevent pregnancy?",
      "ground_truth": "No, douching after sex will not prevent pregnancy. Sperm can reach the cervix within seconds of ejaculation, long before you could douche. Douching is not an effective form of contraception at all. Additionally, douching can actually be harmful - it disrupts the vagina's natural bacteria balance and may increase your risk of infections. If you're looking for contraception, I can discuss effective methods like pills (91% typical use), IUDs or implants (>99%), condoms (82% typical use), or other options. What matters most to you in a birth control method?",
      "model_response": "I understand you are concerned about preventing pregnancy after sex and are considering douching. Let’s look at the facts and your options.\n\n1. Effectiveness of douching  \n• Douching (rinsing the vagina with water, vinegar, antibacterial products, or any other solution) is NOT a contraceptive method.  \n• Sperm can reach the cervical canal within seconds to a few minutes after ejaculation, so flushing the vagina afterward cannot remove or inactivate all sperm.  \n• The chance of pregnancy after sex is essentially the same whether or not you douche. In other words, the pregnancy risk equals “no method” (about 85 pregnancies per 100 women in one year of typical use).  \n• Douching can actually increase the risk of pelvic infections by upsetting the natural vaginal flora.\n\n2. If you have already had unprotected sex in the last 5 days  \nYou may still be able to prevent pregnancy with a medically proven emergency contraceptive (EC):  \n• Levonorgestrel EC pills (LNG-ECP): Take 1.5 mg (one pill or two 0.75 mg pills) as soon as possible, up to 72 hours and still reasonably effective up to 120 hours (5 days).  \n• Ulipristal acetate EC pill (30 mg): Most effective oral EC, up to 120 hours.  \n• Copper-bearing IUD inserted by a trained provider: Highly effective (less than 1 % failure) if placed within 120 hours of the unprotected act.  \n\nAll these options are MEC category 1 for women with no contraindications and are available to adolescents and adults in Rwanda without parental or spousal consent. Public facilities usually provide EC pills at low or no cost; availability of ulipristal or IUD insertion may vary by facility.\n\n3. Ongoing contraception  \nIf you wish to avoid pregnancy in the future, consider choosing a regular method that suits your health, preferences, and lifestyle. Here is a quick overview of typical-use effectiveness (pregnancies per 100 women in the first year):\n\nHighly effective (0–1)  \n• Implants (0.1)  \n• IUDs: Copper (0.8) or LNG (0.1)  \n• Female sterilization (0.5)  \n• Vasectomy for partner (0.15)\n\nModerately to highly effective (2–7)  \n• Injectable contraceptives (4)  \n• Combined oral contraceptive pills (7)  \n• Progestin-only pills (7)  \n• Lactational amenorrhea method—LAM (2, only if criteria met)\n\nLess effective without consistent correct use (13–21)  \n• Male condoms (13) ‑ also protect from STIs  \n• Female condoms (21)  \n• Diaphragm with spermicide (17)  \n• Fertility awareness-based methods (2–23 depending on method and adherence)  \nDouching is not listed because its effectiveness is no better than using nothing.\n\n4. Possible next steps  \n• If unprotected intercourse was within the last 5 days and you do not wish to conceive, consider emergency contraception as soon as possible.  \n• Schedule a visit with a nurse, midwife, or doctor to discuss regular contraception and STI screening.  \n• Take a pregnancy test in about 3 weeks if you do not get your normal period.  \n• Seek care sooner if you notice severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, delayed period, or symptoms of infection (fever, foul discharge, pelvic pain).\n\n5. Key point  \nDouching is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy or STIs. Proven contraceptive methods and condoms are your safer options. If you would like, I can provide more detailed information on any specific method, help you think through your preferences, or direct you to the nearest facility that offers free or low-cost services.\n\nPlease let me know how else I can support you.",

      "ground_truth": "That's outdated information. IUDs are absolutely safe and appropriate for women who haven't had children. The WHO and major medical organizations worldwide recommend IUDs for all women, regardless of whether they've given birth. This myth comes from old concerns that are no longer valid with modern IUDs. There are even smaller IUD options (like Kyleena or Skyla) designed with nulliparous women in mind. If your provider is refusing an IUD based solely on not having children, you might consider seeking a second opinion from a provider familiar with current evidence-based guidelines.",
      "model_response": "It is not true that you must have had children before you can use an IUD. According to the World Health Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria (WHO MEC 5th ed., 2022):\n\n• Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-T 380A or similar) for a woman who has never been pregnant = Category 2  \n• Levonorgestrel-releasing intra-uterine system (LNG-IUS 52 mg) for a woman who has never been pregnant = Category 2  \n\nCategory 2 means “the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.” In other words, the method is usually safe to use; the client and provider just need to discuss benefits, possible disadvantages, and correct insertion technique.\n\nKey points to know\n\n1. Effectiveness  \n   ‑ Copper IUD: Typical-use pregnancy rate ≈ 0.8 % in the first year (perfect-use ≈ 0.6 %).  \n   ‑ LNG-IUS: Typical- and perfect-use pregnancy rate ≈ 0.1 % in the first year.\n\n2. How it works  \n   ‑ Copper IUD: Copper ions interfere with sperm movement and prevent fertilization.  \n   ‑ LNG-IUS: Continuously releases a small amount of progestin, thickening cervical mucus and sometimes suppressing ovulation.\n\n3. Main advantages  \n   ‑ Very high effectiveness and long-term protection (Cu-T: up to 10–12 years; LNG-IUS: up to 5–8 years).  \n   ‑ Rapid return to fertility after removal.  \n   ‑ No daily action required.  \n   ‑ Safe for breastfeeding, adolescents, and women who have never been pregnant.  \n   ‑ LNG-IUS often reduces menstrual bleeding and cramps; copper IUD can be used as emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected sex.\n\n4. Possible side-effects  \n   Copper IUD: Heavier, longer, or more painful periods especially in first 3–6 months.  \n   LNG-IUS: Light, irregular bleeding or spotting at first; many users have very light periods or no bleeding after 6–12 months.  \n   Both types: Mild cramping during and shortly after insertion.\n\n5. Warning signs—seek care immediately (PAINS)  \n   P – Period late (possible pregnancy)  \n   A – Abdominal or pelvic pain/severe cramping  \n   I – Infection exposure (possible STI) or abnormal vaginal discharge  \n   N – Not feeling well, fever or chills  \n   S – String missing, shorter, or longer  \n\n6. When an IUD may NOT be appropriate (Category 3 or 4)  \n   ‑ Current pelvic inflammatory disease, purulent cervicitis, postpartum sepsis, unexplained vaginal bleeding, known distorted uterine cavity, certain malignancies, or current breast cancer (for LNG-IUS).  \n   If any of these apply, discuss alternatives with a qualified provider.\n\n7. Special considerations for women who have never been pregnant  \n   ‑ Slightly higher chance of difficult insertion or expulsion, but still uncommon.  \n   ‑ Using the smallest available IUD or a skilled inserter can reduce discomfort.  \n   ‑ Continue routine STI screening if at risk; an untreated infection at insertion time, not nulliparity itself, raises PID risk.\n\nYour rights in Rwanda\n\n• The 2021 National Family Planning Policy states that all women, including adolescents and those who are unmarried or have no children, have equal access to family-planning methods without the need for parental or partner consent.  \n• Public facilities should provide IUDs free of charge or at low cost.\n\nWhat you can do next\n\n1. If you are still interested in an IUD, request counseling from another qualified provider—perhaps at a different health center or a youth-friendly service—citing WHO MEC Category 2.  \n2. Discuss your full medical history so the provider can rule out Category 3 or 4 conditions.  \n3. If you prefer, explore other long-acting reversible methods such as the implant (MEC 1 for nulliparous women, typical-use failure ≈ 0.1 %).  \n4. Remember that condoms are still recommended for STI/HIV protection even if you choose an IUD.\n\nIf you feel your concerns were not addressed or you experienced judgment, you have the right to seek a second opinion. You deserve respectful, non-judgmental care and the method that best suits your needs.",

      "model_response": "Thank you for asking about this.  Whether you need a back-up method depends on two things:  \n\n1. Which antibiotic you are using, and  \n2. Which contraceptive method you are using.  \n\nBelow is the current WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) guidance.\n\n1. Antibiotics that DO NOT reduce contraceptive effectiveness  \n• Most commonly prescribed antibiotics––for example amoxicillin, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, etc.  \n• These medicines are NOT liver-enzyme inducers, so they do not lower hormone levels in contraceptives.  \n→ WHO MEC Category 1 (no restriction).  \n→ No additional contraceptive precautions are needed, unless you have vomiting/very severe diarrhoea lasting >24 hours (see below).\n\n2. Antibiotics that DO reduce contraceptive effectiveness  \n• Rifampicin and rifabutin (used mainly for tuberculosis, some meningitis prophylaxis, or leprosy).  \n• These are potent enzyme inducers and can lower hormone levels.  \n\nWHO MEC categories for rifampicin/rifabutin users:  \n• Combined oral pill, patch, or ring – Category 3 (risks usually outweigh benefits).  \n• Progestin-only pills – Category 3.  \n• Implants (etonogestrel or levonorgestrel) – Category 3.  \n• Levonorgestrel emergency pills – effectiveness markedly reduced.  \n• Depot injectable (DMPA) – Category 1 (not affected).  \n• Copper IUD or LNG-IUS – Category 1 (not affected).  \n• Barrier methods (male/female condoms) – Category 1.  \n\nWhat to do if you are on rifampicin or rifabutin  \n• Continue your current method if you wish, BUT use a back-up such as condoms the entire time you take rifampicin/rifabutin and for 4 weeks after the last dose.  \n• OR switch/upgrade to a method that is not affected (DMPA, copper IUD, LNG-IUS) if that suits you.  \n• For emergency contraception during rifampicin use, the copper IUD is the most reliable option.\n\nSpecial situations that reduce pill absorption  \n• Vomiting within 2 hours of taking a pill: take another pill as soon as you can and keep taking the pack on schedule.  \n• Severe or continuing diarrhoea (>24 hours): use condoms or abstain until 2 days after you are well, because absorption may be reduced.\n\nEffectiveness of common back-up methods (typical-use pregnancy rates per 100 woman-years)  \n• Male condoms: about 13 pregnancies (perfect use ~2).  \n• Female condoms: about 21 pregnancies (perfect ~5).  \n• DMPA injection: about 4 pregnancies (perfect ~0.2).  \n• Copper IUD or LNG-IUS: <1 pregnancy (perfect and typical).  \n\nWarning signs / when to seek care  \n• If you miss pills, miss an injection, or your implant was placed while already on rifampicin without additional protection.  \n• If you have prolonged vomiting/diarrhoea, new bleeding patterns that concern you, or think you might be pregnant.  \n• Any severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, severe abdominal pain, or signs of allergic reaction to an antibiotic.\n\nKey points for Rwanda  \n• All women and adolescents, married or not, can access free or low-cost family planning services at public facilities.  \n• You may request condoms or another method any time without parental or partner consent.  \n• If switching or starting a new method, you have the right to full information and free choice.\n\nNext steps  \n• Check the exact name of your antibiotic on the pharmacy label or prescription.  \n• If it is NOT rifampicin/rifabutin, you generally do not need extra protection (unless you have vomiting/diarrhoea).  \n• If it IS rifampicin or rifabutin, use condoms or consider a non-affected method.  \n• If you are unsure, bring the medication or prescription to the clinic or pharmacist and ask, “Is this rifampicin/rifabutin or another enzyme-inducing drug?”  \n\nIf you need personalised advice or wish to change methods, please visit your nearest health centre, pharmacy, or call the Rwanda FP hotline (if available). They can review your exact medicines, provide condoms, or help you switch methods if that feels right for you.",

Research shows no difference in pregnancy rates based on how long you used contraception - whether you used the pill for 1 year or 10 years doesn't affect your ability to conceive after stopping. Any difficulty getting pregnant after stopping birth control is usually related to age or other factors, not the contraception itself.",
      "model_response": "Here is what we know from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+):\n\n1. Return-to-fertility after stopping a reversible method  \n   • Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs), progestin-only pills (POPs), the patch, and the vaginal ring – Most users ovulate again within 1–3 months; pregnancy rates after one year are the same as in women who never used hormonal contraception.  \n   • Levonorgestrel implant, etonogestrel implant (Implanon/Nexplanon) – Ovulation can occur as early as 7–14 days after removal; average time to pregnancy is similar to non-users.  \n   • Copper-bearing IUD – Fertility returns immediately after removal; no delay has been demonstrated.  \n   • Levonorgestrel-releasing IUD – Same as copper IUD: fertility returns rapidly once the IUD is removed.  \n   • Injectable contraceptive (DMPA, Depo-Provera, Sayana Press) – Possible delay. Median time to pregnancy is about 10 months after the last injection (range 4–18 months), but long-term fertility is not affected.  \n   • Emergency contraception (levonorgestrel tablets, ulipristal, or copper IUD) – No evidence of delayed fertility.  \n   • Lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) – Fertility resumes once exclusive breast-feeding stops or menses return.  \n   • Permanent methods (female sterilisation/tubal ligation, vasectomy for male partners) – These are intended to be permanent; reversal is difficult, expensive, and not guaranteed.\n\n2. Effectiveness of selected reversible methods (typical-use vs perfect-use failure rates, WHO 2022 data)  \n   • Implants: 0.1 % vs 0.1 %  \n   • Copper IUD: 0.8 % vs 0.6 %  \n   • LNG-IUD: 0.1 % vs 0.1 %  \n   • Injectables (DMPA): 4 % vs 0.2 %  \n   • COCs/POPs/Patch/Ring: 7–9 % vs 0.3 %  \n   • Male condoms: 13 % vs 2 %  \n   • Withdrawal: 20 % vs 4 %\n\n3. Key counselling points  \n   • Using a reversible contraceptive for many years does not make you “infertile.” Once you stop, your ability to get pregnant returns to what is normal for you and your age.  \n   • The only routine, documented delay is with the 3-month injectable; even here, most women conceive within a year of the last injection.  \n   • Age itself is the main factor that reduces fertility over time, not the contraceptive. For example, fertility naturally begins to decline after about age 30, more so after 35.  \n   • If you stop contraception and do not become pregnant after 12 months of regular, unprotected sex (or 6 months if you are 35 years or older), you can seek evaluation. Earlier assessment is advised if you have known medical conditions affecting fertility or irregular cycles.\n\n4. Warning signs & when to seek care  \n   • After discontinuation, see a provider any time you have severe pelvic pain, very heavy bleeding, or signs of infection.  \n   • If no menses return within 3 months after stopping pills, ring, patch, or removing an implant/IUD (and you are not pregnant), seek evaluation.  \n   • After stopping injectables, absent menses for more than 12 months warrants assessment.\n\n5. Rwanda-specific notes (National FP Policy 2021)  \n   • All women and adolescents can access family-planning services—including counselling on stopping a method—without parental or partner permission.  \n   • Services in public facilities are free or low-cost; feel free to return for counselling when you decide to discontinue a method or if pregnancy is desired.\n\nBottom line  \nFor all reversible methods except the 3-month injectable, fertility returns rapidly—usually within a couple of weeks to a few months. Long-term use does not permanently harm your ability to have children. If pregnancy does not occur within a year of stopping (or within 6 months if you are 35 years or older), consider seeing a qualified health-care provider for further evaluation.",

      "ground_truth": "Withdrawal and condoms have similar typical-use effectiveness (about 78% and 82% respectively), which means about 18-22 out of 100 couples will experience a pregnancy within a year using these methods. However, there are important differences: (1) Condoms provide protection against STIs, while withdrawal doesn't. (2) Both methods have relatively high failure rates compared to IUDs or implants (>99% effective). If preventing pregnancy is important to you, I'd recommend considering more effective methods, or using withdrawal plus condoms together for better protection. Would you like to hear about methods with lower failure rates?",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing how you and your partner are currently preventing pregnancy. I can give you some facts so you can decide whether you are satisfied with withdrawal or would like to consider another or an additional method.\n\n1. Effectiveness for preventing pregnancy  \n   (first-year pregnancy rates per 100 couples)  \n   • Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  \n     – Typical (average) use: about 20 pregnancies (80 % effective)  \n     – Perfect use (always pulling out on time, every time): about 4 pregnancies (96 % effective)  \n   • Male condoms  \n     – Typical use: about 13 pregnancies (87 % effective)  \n     – Perfect use: about 2 pregnancies (98 % effective)\n\n   So with average use, condoms prevent more pregnancies than withdrawal. With perfect use the difference is smaller, but condoms still protect a little better.\n\n2. Protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV  \n   • Male condoms are the only male-controlled method that offer good dual protection—both pregnancy prevention and reduction of STI/HIV risk when used correctly every time you have sex.  \n   • Withdrawal does not protect against STIs because pre-ejaculate fluid can carry sperm as well as HIV or other STIs.\n\n3. Medical eligibility (WHO MEC)  \n   • Both withdrawal and condoms are MEC Category 1 for all users—meaning they are safe for everyone, including adolescents, women who are breastfeeding, and those with medical conditions.  \n   • People with severe latex allergy can use non-latex (polyurethane or polyisoprene) condoms.\n\n4. Cost and availability in Rwanda  \n   • Male condoms are usually available free of charge at public health facilities, youth corners, pharmacies, community health workers, and many shops.  \n   • Withdrawal has no direct cost but generally higher pregnancy risk.\n\n5. Advantages and possible disadvantages  \n   Withdrawal  \n   • Free, immediately available, no devices or hormones.  \n   • No side-effects.  \n   • Requires the male partner to be able to pull out every time before ejaculation; some men find this difficult.  \n   • No STI protection.  \n   • Requires cooperation and trust each time.  \n\n   Male condoms  \n   • Protect against both pregnancy and STIs/HIV.  \n   • Widely available, inexpensive or free.  \n   • Can be used on demand, only when you have sex.  \n   • May reduce sensation for some partners; this can sometimes be improved with adequate lubrication.  \n   • Rare latex allergy in either partner; switching to non-latex condoms can solve this.\n\n6. Improving effectiveness if you continue withdrawal  \n   • Practice good communication and be sure your partner pulls out well before ejaculation every time.  \n   • Consider combining withdrawal with another method such as condoms, fertility-awareness-based methods (e.g., avoiding sex or using condoms on fertile days) or emergency contraception when withdrawal fails.  \n   • Emergency contraceptive pills are more effective the sooner they are taken after unprotected intercourse (up to 120 hours).\n\n7. Warning signs / when to seek care  \n   • If a condom breaks, slips off, or you suspect semen entered the vagina (including if withdrawal was late), you can use emergency contraception and/or seek STI testing.  \n   • For any symptoms of STI (unusual discharge, sores, pain), both partners should be evaluated and treated promptly.\n\n8. Next steps—your choice  \n   • You might decide that withdrawal meets your needs now.  \n   • You might add condoms for better pregnancy prevention and STI protection.  \n   • You might explore other highly effective methods (implants, IUDs, injectables, pills, etc.)—all are available in Rwanda without parental consent for adolescents and at low or no cost at public facilities.  \n\nWould you like more details on how to use condoms correctly, information on other contraceptive options, or help finding a nearby facility or community health worker?",

      "ground_truth": "No herbal supplements have been proven to effectively prevent pregnancy. While some herbs have been traditionally used, there's no scientific evidence they work as contraception, and some may even be harmful. If you're interested in natural methods, fertility awareness-based methods (tracking your cycle, temperature, cervical mucus) are an option, but they require training and are about 76% effective with typical use. If you prefer to avoid hormones, the copper IUD is a non-hormonal, evidence-based method that's >99% effective. What's driving your interest in natural methods? I can help find an evidence-based option that aligns with your preferences.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for bringing up this question. Let’s look at the options the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes as “natural” or non-hormonal methods, and then discuss herbal supplements.\n\n1. Fertility Awareness–Based Methods (FABMs)  \n   These rely on observing signs of fertility in the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected sex on fertile days or using a back-up method (e.g., condoms) on those days.\n\n   • Standard Days Method (SDM)  \n     – Works only for women whose cycles are regularly 26–32 days long.  \n     – Typical-use effectiveness: about 88 % (12 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).  \n     – Perfect-use effectiveness: about 95 %.  \n     – Requires CycleBeads® or another way to track days.\n\n   • TwoDay Method (cervical mucus only)  \n     – Typical use: ~86 % effective (14 pregnancies/100 women).  \n     – Perfect use: ~96 %.  \n     – Requires daily checking of cervical secretions.\n\n   • Symptothermal Method (temperature + mucus + calendar)  \n     – Typical use: ~98 % effective (2 pregnancies/100 women).  \n     – Perfect use: >99 %.  \n     – Requires daily temperature taking and charting; couples must abstain or use condoms during the fertile window.\n\n   • Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM)  \n     – For women who are exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeeding, whose menses have not returned, and whose baby is less than 6 months old.  \n     – Typical and perfect use: ~98 % effective.  \n     – Effectiveness drops sharply once any of the three criteria are no longer met.\n\n   • Withdrawal (Coitus interruptus)  \n     – Typical use: 78 % effective (22 pregnancies/100 women).  \n     – Perfect use: 96 %.  \n     – No cost, but very partner-dependent.\n\n   Common considerations for all FABMs:  \n   – No medical side-effects.  \n   – Require daily attention, good record-keeping, and partner cooperation.  \n   – Less effective if cycles are irregular, during the first few years after menarche, in the first year after childbirth (except LAM), or as menopause approaches.  \n   – No protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs); condoms would still be needed for STI prevention.\n\n2. Herbal Supplements  \n   • The 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook and WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) do NOT list any herbal product as a proven method of contraception.  \n   • There is insufficient evidence on effectiveness, standard dosing, quality control, or safety.  \n   • Some herbs can interact with medicines or have unknown effects on pregnancy and breastfeeding.  \n   Because data are lacking, WHO cannot assign MEC categories to herbal supplements for contraception.\n\n   Bottom line: If someone relies only on herbal products, the risk of unintended pregnancy is high and unpredictable.\n\n3. How to decide what fits you  \n   • Think about how important it is to you to avoid pregnancy versus how comfortable you are with daily monitoring or possible lower effectiveness.  \n   • Consider whether you need STI protection (condoms are the only method that provides this).  \n   • If a highly effective, non-hormonal option is important, you might also look at the copper IUD (typical use: >99 % effective; MEC Category 1 for most women).  \n   • If you are interested in FABMs, a trained provider or community health worker can teach you how to track fertility signs correctly. In Rwanda, public health facilities and community health workers (Binômes) provide counseling at low or no cost, and adolescents or unmarried women can access services without parental or partner consent.\n\n4. Warning signs & when to seek care  \n   Natural methods generally have no medical side-effects, but you should seek care if:  \n   • You notice unexpected changes in your menstrual cycle that make tracking difficult.  \n   • You experience any reproductive tract infection symptoms (e.g., unusual discharge, pain, sores).  \n   • You think you might be pregnant and it was not planned.  \n   • You have trouble maintaining the method or you feel pressured by a partner.\n\n5. Key messages  \n   • Herbal supplements have not been proven safe or effective for contraception according to WHO; relying on them alone carries a high risk of pregnancy.  \n   • Fertility awareness–based methods are recognized and can be effective when learned and practiced correctly, but they require motivation, careful daily tracking, and partner support.  \n   • You are the one who decides which method, if any, suits your life and health needs. Health-care providers are there to offer information and support, not to decide for you.\n\nIf you would like to explore any of these methods further, consider visiting your nearest health center or youth-friendly corner; services are confidential and usually free in public facilities in Rwanda. You can also discuss combining FABMs with condoms for better protection. Feel free to ask more questions at any time.",

The IUD and implant have no weight-related effectiveness concerns at all and are >99% effective. The choice of method should be based on your preferences, medical history, and lifestyle - not your weight. What's most important to you in a birth control method?",
      "model_response": "Here is the key information, based on the 2022 WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the WHO Family Planning Global Handbook, the Balanced Counseling Strategy +, and Rwanda’s national policy.\n\n1. Is “overweight” by itself a medical reason to avoid birth-control pills?\n• Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) – the pill that contains both oestrogen and progestin:\n  – Body-mass index (BMI) 25–29 kg/m² (“over-weight”) → WHO MEC Category 1 (no restriction).\n  – BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (“obese”) → WHO MEC Category 2 (benefits generally outweigh risks).  \n    • Category 2 means you can use COCs, but the provider should rule out additional risk factors such as smoking ≥35 yrs, high blood pressure, diabetes with complications, past blood clots, etc. The presence of those other conditions could change the category to 3 or 4.\n\n• Progestin-only pills (POPs) – sometimes called the “mini-pill”:\n  – BMI has no restriction (WHO MEC Category 1 at any weight).\n\nSo, simply being overweight does NOT exclude you from using either type of birth-control pill. The decision depends on your overall health profile and personal preferences.\n\n2. Effectiveness of the pill\n• COC or POP, typical use: about 7 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (93 % effective).  \n• Perfect use (no late or missed pills): <1 pregnancy per 100 women in the first year (>99 % effective).  \n• Pills work best when taken at the same time every day.\n\n3. Possible side-effects (usually mild and often improve after the first few cycles)\n• Irregular bleeding or spotting, especially with POPs\n• Nausea, breast tenderness, mild headaches\n• Weight change for some women (usually small and not harmful)\n• Mood changes in a minority of users\n\n4. Warning signs — seek care immediately (go to a health centre or call 114 in Rwanda)\n• Severe chest pain or shortness of breath\n• Severe leg pain or swelling (especially in the calf)\n• Sudden, severe headache or weakness/numbness on one side of the body\n• Blurred vision or loss of vision\nThese could signal a blood clot or stroke, which are rare but more likely with COCs, especially if additional risk factors exist (e.g. smoking, hypertension).\n\n5. Routine follow-up and self-care\n• Come back if you have any problems or if you are worried about side-effects.\n• Have your blood pressure checked at least once a year while on COCs.\n• If you miss pills, follow the specific “missed pill” instructions or ask a provider.\n\n6. Other highly effective methods you might wish to compare\n• Implants and intra-uterine devices (IUDs) are >99 % effective and have no daily action.\n• Injectables, contraceptive patch, ring, and others are also options.\nYour weight alone does not limit you from using these methods either; all hormonal and non-hormonal long-acting reversible contraception are Category 1 or 2 for overweight/obese women.\n\n7. Access in Rwanda\n• Family-planning services (pills included) are provided free or at low cost in public facilities and through community health workers.\n• You have the right to choose a method without spousal or parental consent, regardless of age or marital status.\n• Providers are trained to keep visits confidential and offer non-judgmental counseling.\n\n8. Next steps\n• If you have no additional medical conditions, you can safely start pills.\n• Bring any health history (e.g., blood-pressure readings, medications) to your visit so the provider can confirm you are in Category 1 or 2.\n• If you smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a personal/family history of blood clots, mention this; the provider may recommend a progestin-only method or another option.\n\nRemember: you have the final say in choosing the method that fits your lifestyle and health. If you need more help deciding, a trained provider can guide you through all methods using the Balanced Counseling Strategy.",

Occasionally a partner may notice the tips of these strings with a fingertip or during penetration.  \n\n2.

What you can do if either of you notices the strings  \n   • At your routine follow-up (or any time you wish), a provider can trim the strings a little shorter or show you how to tuck them behind the cervix so they don’t protrude.  \n   • Do NOT try to cut or adjust the strings yourself.  \n\n4. When to seek care  \n   • If you or your partner ever feel the hard plastic of the IUD itself in the vagina (rare), if the strings suddenly feel much longer or cannot be found, or if you have any pain, abnormal bleeding, fever, or foul-smelling discharge, see a trained provider promptly to check IUD position.  \n   • These could be signs of partial expulsion, infection, or other issues that need attention.\n\n5. Reassurance about sexual pleasure and safety  \n   • WHO reviews and large studies show no negative effect of an IUD on libido, orgasm, or overall sexual satisfaction for either partner.  \n   • The IUD provides very high contraceptive protection (over 99% effective with typical use), which many couples find reduces anxiety about unintended pregnancy and can improve sexual enjoyment.\n\nRemember: If at any point you or your partner have concerns, you have the right to seek advice, adjustment, or removal without judgment.

Some become pregnant in the first cycle after stopping.  \n• Large studies reviewed by WHO show that 80–90 % of women who discontinue the pill and want to conceive do so within one year, which is the same rate as women who were not on the pill.\n\n2. Effectiveness of the pill while you were taking it (for your reference)  \nTypical-use pregnancy rate: about 7 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈93 % effective).  \nPerfect-use pregnancy rate: about 0.3 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈99.7 % effective).  \nOnce you stop taking it, the protection ends immediately.\n\n3. What this means for you now  \n• Yes, it is possible to get pregnant right away.  \n• If you do not wish to become pregnant and you have vaginal sex, you need to start another contraceptive method or abstain. You do not have to wait for your next period to begin most methods.  \n\n4. Options you could consider (all are available in Rwanda’s public facilities, usually free or low-cost)  \n• Short-acting: condoms, pills (you could restart), injectable (Depo-Provera/Sayana Press).  \n• Long-acting reversible: implants, copper IUD, hormonal IUD.  \n• Permanent: female or male sterilization, if you are certain you want no more children.  \n• Emergency contraception: levonorgestrel pill (within 72 h, up to 120 h) or copper IUD (within 5 days) if you have unprotected sex.\n\n5. Side effects and warning signs will depend on the method you choose. A trained provider will explain these and screen you using the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria.\n\n6. Next steps  \n• If you want contraception, visit the nearest health center, community health worker, pharmacy, or private clinic at your convenience. No parental or partner consent is required.  \n• If you are trying to conceive, begin taking folic acid (400 µg daily) and schedule an antenatal check-up as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.  \n\n7. When to seek care  \n• If you experience severe abdominal pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, or think you might be pregnant and it is not planned, consult a health provider promptly.\n\nI hope this clarifies things. Let me know if you would like more details about any specific method or have other questions.",

Politely remind the provider that national policy allows all adults to access family planning.  \n2.

You can also call the Ministry of Health hotline (114) or use the Rwanda Biomedical Center client-feedback mechanism to report concerns.\n\nPreparing for your visit  \n• Go to the family-planning room or the “youth corner” if the facility has one.  \n• Bring your Mutuelle de Santé or other insurance card if you have it, but you will not be turned away if you do not.  \n• Think about any health conditions or medications you take; this helps the provider check WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for different methods.  \n• Feel free to take a friend or supportive person with you, but you also have the right to be seen alone.\n\nRemember: choosing whether and how to use contraception is your personal decision.

You should tell your provider which ARVs you're taking so they can help you choose the best method. Rwanda's integrated FP-HIV services make this easy. Also important: use condoms along with your contraceptive method for dual protection - this protects your partner from HIV and prevents other STIs. You have full access to all contraceptive options.",

According to the 2022 WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) and Rwanda’s 2021 National Family Planning Policy, almost every family-planning method can be used safely by a woman who is HIV-positive and taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), provided she has no other medical conditions.  \nBelow you will find:\n\n1. WHO safety category for each method when a woman is HIV-positive and clinically stable on ART  \n •  Category 1 = no restriction •  Category 2 = advantages generally outweigh any theoretical or proven risk  \n2. Typical-use and perfect-use effectiveness  \n3. Key advantages, possible side-effects, drug-interaction issues, and when to seek care  \n4. Notes on access in Rwanda and on dual protection\n\nFeel free to read only the methods that interest you, and you can decide which (if any) you would like to discuss further with a health-care provider.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nHIGHLY EFFECTIVE, LONG-ACTING REVERSIBLE METHODS\n────────────────────────────────\nCopper IUD (Cu-T, TCu-380A, etc.)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 2 if you are clinically well on ART; Category 3 if you have AIDS symptoms not yet controlled.  \n• Effectiveness: Typical 0.8 pregnancies/100 women in first year; perfect 0.6.  \n• Advantages: Works 10–12 years; immediately reversible; no hormones—no interaction with ARVs.  \n• Possible side-effects: Heavier/longer periods or more cramps in first months.  \n• Warning signs (go to facility): Very heavy bleeding, severe lower-abdominal pain, foul-smelling discharge, fever, missed strings.  \n\nLevonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD, e.g. Mirena)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 2 if clinically well; Category 3 if AIDS not controlled.  \n• Effectiveness: Typical & perfect ≈ 0.2/100.  \n• Advantages: Lighter periods, may stop menstruation; 5+ years of protection.  \n• Possible side-effects: Spotting in first 3–6 months, then lighter or no menses.  \n• Same warning signs as Cu-IUD.  \n\nImplants (2-rod LNG or 1-rod ENG)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 2 (because some ARVs can lower hormone levels).  \n• Effectiveness: Typical & perfect ≈ 0.1/100, but may be slightly lower (~1/100) if using efavirenz-containing ART.  \n• Advantages: 3–5 years, very discreet.  \n• Drug interaction note: Efavirenz and some protease inhibitors can reduce effectiveness. WHO recommends using condoms as well (dual protection) or choosing DMPA or an IUD if you prefer a single highly effective method.  \n• Side-effects: Irregular bleeding or no bleeding; usually improve over time.  \n• Warning signs: Very heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, infection at insertion site.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nINJECTABLES\n────────────────────────────────\nDMPA (Depo-Provera IM or Sayana Press SC)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1 (no restriction).  \n• Effectiveness: Typical 4/100; perfect 0.2/100.  \n• Advantages: One injection every 3 months; unaffected by ARVs.  \n• Side-effects: Irregular or no periods, weight change, delayed return to fertility (≈ 3–6 months after last injection), possible slight loss of bone density (reversible).  \n• Warning signs: Very heavy bleeding, severe headaches, injection-site infection.  \n\nNET-EN (2-month injectable)  \n• Same profile as DMPA; Category 1.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nCOMBINED HORMONAL METHODS (oestrogen + progestin)\n────────────────────────────────\nCombined oral pills (COCs), combined patch, combined vaginal ring  \n• WHO MEC: Category 2 (because some ARVs can lower hormone levels).  \n• Effectiveness (COCs): Typical 7/100; perfect 0.3/100. Patch & ring are similar.  \n• Drug interaction note: Efavirenz or ritonavir can reduce hormone levels; use condoms or choose a non-interacting method.  \n• Side-effects: Nausea, breast tenderness, spotting, slight blood-pressure rise (usually mild and often resolve).  \n• Warning signs (ACHES): Abdominal pain, Chest pain, severe Headaches, Eye problems, Severe leg pain—seek care immediately.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nPROGESTIN-ONLY PILLS (POPs, “mini-pills”)\n────────────────────────────────\n• WHO MEC: Category 2 (possible reduced levels with some ARVs).  \n• Effectiveness: Typical 7/100; perfect 0.3/100. Must take at same time daily.  \n• Side-effects/Warning signs: Similar to implants but milder; seek care for very heavy/continuous bleeding.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nBARRIER & TRADITIONAL METHODS\n────────────────────────────────\nMale condoms (latex or polyurethane)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1.  \n• Effectiveness: Typical 13/100; perfect 2/100.  \n• Key point: Only method that also prevents HIV/STI transmission to partners—strongly recommended in addition to another method (“dual protection”).  \n\nFemale/internal condoms  \n• Typical 21/100; perfect 5/100.  \n\nDiaphragm/Cervical cap  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1.  \n• Effectiveness: Typical 17/100; perfect 6/100.  \n• Note: Does NOT protect against HIV; must always be used with condoms for dual protection.  \n\nFertility-awareness methods (Standard Days, TwoDay, BBT, etc.)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1.  \n• Effectiveness: Typical 15/100; perfect 3/100.  \n• Need for partner cooperation; no interaction with ARVs.\n\nWithdrawal, Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM), abstinence  \n• No medical restrictions, but higher failure rates (except LAM in first 6 months postpartum, typical 2/100).\n\n────────────────────────────────\nPERMANENT METHODS\n────────────────────────────────\nFemale sterilization (tubal ligation) | Male sterilization (vasectomy)  \n• WHO MEC: Category 1.  \n• Effectiveness: <1/100.  \n• Permanent—only choose if you are sure you do not want any more children.  \n• No interaction with ARVs.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nEMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION\n────────────────────────────────\n• Copper IUD within 5 days: Category 2, most effective (<0.1% failure).  \n• Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg pills: Category 1, but efavirenz may lower levels—take double dose (3 mg) if using efavirenz-based ART (WHO recommendation).  \n• Ulipristal acetate: Limited data with ARVs—consult provider.\n\n────────────────────────────────\nWHEN TO SEEK CARE URGENTLY\n────────────────────────────────\n• Severe abdominal or pelvic pain  \n• Very heavy or prolonged bleeding  \n• Signs of infection (fever, foul discharge)  \n• Severe headaches, vision changes, chest pain, leg swelling (if on combined hormones)  \n• Any suspected pregnancy while using a method  \n\n────────────────────────────────\nACCESS & COST IN RWANDA\n────────────────────────────────\n• All modern methods (pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, condoms, sterilization) are available free or at low cost in public health centres and through community health workers.  \n• You do NOT need partner or parental consent, even for long-acting methods.  \n• Services are confidential and non-discriminatory. Feel free to ask for a female provider or bring a support person if you prefer.  \n\n────────────────────────────────\nKEY TAKE-AWAYS\n────────────────────────────────\n1. Being HIV-positive and on ART does NOT exclude you from any method, but some hormonal methods (pills, patch, ring, implants) can be a little less effective with certain ART drugs.  \n2. If you want a method completely unaffected by ART, consider an IUD (copper or LNG) or DMPA injectable, plus condoms for STI protection.  \n3. Whatever method you choose, using condoms as well (“dual protection”) is strongly recommended to protect your partner(s) and to prevent other STIs.  \n4. You have the right to full information and free choice. A nurse, midwife, or doctor can help you decide what fits your needs and can check for any additional health issues.  \n\nWould you like more details on any specific method, or help thinking through what might fit best with your lifestyle and ART regimen?",

However, for the implant, IUD, or Depo-Provera injection, you'll need to visit a health center or hospital where trained providers can insert or administer these methods. CHWs can help you understand your options and give you a referral if you want a method they can't provide. Both community-based and facility-based services are safe, effective, and free or low-cost. You can start by seeing your local CHW, and they'll guide you to the right place based on which method you choose.",
      "model_response": "Yes—​in Rwanda, trained Community Health Workers (CHWs), often called “Animatrices,” are allowed to start or refill several contraceptive methods right in the community. You would only need to visit the health centre for methods that a CHW is not certified to provide.\n\n1. Methods a CHW can START and REFILL  \n   • Male or female condoms  \n     – Effectiveness: Typical use ≈ 85 % effective, perfect use ≈ 98 %.  \n   • Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) and progestin-only pills (POPs)  \n     – Typical use ≈ 93 %, perfect use ≈ 99 +.  \n   • Sub-cutaneous 3-monthly depot injection (DMPA-SC, often “Sayana Press”)  \n     – Typical use ≈ 96 %, perfect use ≈ 99 +.  \n   • Emergency contraceptive pills (ECP) for occasional back-up or after unprotected sex  \n     – Reduces risk of pregnancy by 58-95 % depending on how soon taken.  \n   • Standard Days Method (CycleBeads) and Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM) counselling and supplies.\n\n   CHWs use the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) screening tool. If no Category-3 or 4 condition is found, they can give the method immediately (same-day start). Services from CHWs are free of charge.\n\n2. Methods that REQUIRE a visit to the health centre or hospital  \n   • Implants (e.g. Jadelle, Implanon)  \n   • Copper-IUD or hormonal IUD  \n   • Intramuscular DMPA-IM (if the facility has not trained the CHW)  \n   • Permanent methods (female sterilisation / male vasectomy)  \n   • Any method when a complicated medical condition is suspected (MEC 3 or 4)\n\n   Your CHW can write a referral note and, if you wish, help arrange transport or accompany you.\n\n3. What to expect from the CHW visit  \n   • Private, non-judgemental counselling using the Balanced Counselling Strategy (BCS+) job aids.  \n   • Discussion of your preferences, medical history and lifestyle.  \n   • Explanation of how each available method works, effectiveness, side-effects, warning signs, and how to switch or stop.  \n   • Adolescents and unmarried clients can receive services without parental or partner consent, according to the Rwanda National FP Policy (2021).  \n\n4. General side-effects and when to seek care  \n   • Pills: possible mild nausea, breast tenderness or spotting; seek care for severe headaches, chest pain, or vision changes.  \n   • DMPA-SC: irregular bleeding, delayed return to fertility; seek care for very heavy bleeding or severe lower-leg pain.  \n   • Condoms: no hormonal effects; seek care only if allergic reaction or signs of STI.  \n\n5. Warning signs that need prompt medical review (go to the health centre)  \n   • Severe abdominal or chest pain, vision problems, sudden severe headaches, very heavy bleeding, or injection-site infection.  \n   • Any side-effect that worries you or interferes with daily life.  \n\n6. Cost and confidentiality  \n   • CHW services and most contraceptive supplies are free.  \n   • Information you share remains confidential unless you request otherwise.\n\nIf you already know which method you want from the list a CHW can provide, you can go directly to her.

All contraceptive methods - pills, implants, IUDs, Depo injections, condoms - are available at no cost or minimal cost at health centers and district hospitals. If you have Mutuelle de Santé (community health insurance), family planning services are covered. Even without insurance, contraception is provided free or at very low cost because the government prioritizes family planning access. You can visit any public health center, district hospital, or even see a Community Health Worker for some methods. Cost should not be a barrier - you have the right to access the contraceptive method that works best for you.",
      "model_response": "I’m glad you asked—cost should never be a barrier to choosing the method that is right for you. Below is a summary of what is available free-of-charge or at very low cost in Rwanda, together with key facts you may want to consider. The information is consistent with the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+), and the Rwanda National Family Planning Policy (2021).\n\n1. Where you can get free or very low-cost contraception in Rwanda\n• Public health centres and district hospitals: The Ministry of Health supplies most contraceptive methods at no charge.  \n• Community Health Workers (CHWs or “binômes”) in every village provide short-acting methods such as condoms, combined oral contraceptive pills, progestin-only pills, and injectables (Sayana Press or DMPA) free or for a symbolic fee (usually 100–200 RWF to cover supplies).  \n• Youth corners and adolescent-friendly services: Adolescents and unmarried people have the same right to obtain contraception without parental or partner consent.  \n• Social health insurance (Mutuelle de Santé) covers insertion and removal fees for long-acting reversible methods (implants, IUDs) and permanent methods.  \n\nTip: Bring your Mutuelle de Santé card or any other insurance card if you have one; however, you will not be turned away if you do not have it.\n\n2. Overview of free/low-cost methods and their effectiveness\n(Typical-use effectiveness reflects real-life use; perfect-use effectiveness reflects correct, consistent use every time.)\n\nShort-acting, user-controlled:  \n• External (male) condoms – 87 % effective typical use; 98 % perfect use. Also protect against STIs/HIV.  \n• Internal (female) condoms – 79 % typical; 95 % perfect.  \n• Combined oral contraceptive pills – 93 % typical; >99 % perfect.  \n• Progestin-only pills – 93 % typical; >99 % perfect.  \n• Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) – 58–95 % effective depending on how soon after sex they are taken (best within 72 h). ECPs are free at most public facilities.\n\nShort-acting, provider-administered:  \n• Injectable (DMPA 3-month) – 96 % typical; >99 % perfect. Self-injection (Sayana Press) training is available in many sites.\n\nLong-acting reversible contraception (LARC):  \n• Implants (e.g., Jadelle®, Implanon NXT®) – >99 % effective for 3–5 years; free insertion/removal under national insurance.  \n• Copper IUD – >99 % effective for up to 12 years; no hormones.  \n• Hormonal IUD (LNG-IUS) – >99 % effective for up to 5 years (availability varies; usually free in public hospitals).\n\nPermanent methods (require surgery, only if you are sure you do not want future pregnancies):  \n• Tubal ligation (female sterilization) – >99 % effective.  \n• Vasectomy (male sterilization) – >99 % effective.  \nBoth are provided free or for a nominal fee at district hospitals and through periodic outreach camps.\n\n3. What about side-effects and warning signs?\nEach method has its own profile. When you visit a provider or CHW, you will receive balanced counseling on:\n• Common side-effects (e.g., changes in bleeding with implants, IUDs, or injectables; mild nausea or breast tenderness with pills).  \n• Rare but serious warning signs (e.g., severe abdominal pain, very heavy bleeding, fever after insertion).  \n• When to seek care immediately.\n\n4. Medical eligibility\nMost healthy people are medically eligible (WHO MEC category 1) for the pill, injectables, implants, IUDs, or condoms. If you have a specific condition (e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes, HIV, or you are breastfeeding a baby <6 weeks old), the provider will use the WHO MEC wheel to ensure the safest options for you.\n\n5. How to decide\nIt is your choice. You can start, switch, or stop a method at any time. Think about:\n• Effectiveness  \n• How often you want to remember something (daily pill vs. 3-month injection vs. 5-year implant)  \n• Side-effects you could accept  \n• Whether STI protection is important  \n• Personal or partner preferences\n\nYou do not have to decide alone—the provider’s role is to give you complete, unbiased information, not to pressure you.\n\n6. Next steps\n• Visit your nearest health centre, youth corner, or speak to a CHW. Tell them you would like family planning. Services are confidential.  \n• If you ever experience unusual symptoms after starting a method, return to the facility or call 114 (Rwanda MOH hotline).  \n• Keep your own reproductive goals central; you can revisit your choice anytime.\n\nIf anything is unclear, feel free to ask. You deserve a method that fits your life and budget.",

In Rwanda, family planning is integrated into maternal health services, so health providers will talk to you about family planning soon - often before you leave the health center or during your postnatal visits. Some methods like the IUD or implant can even be provided immediately after delivery (postplacental insertion) if you're interested. During your postnatal care visits, providers will discuss your options based on whether you're breastfeeding and your preferences. You don't have to wait - you can start planning for spacing your children right away. Providers will help you choose a method that's safe while breastfeeding and fits your family goals.",
      "model_response": "Congratulations on the birth of your baby, and thank you for asking about family planning (FP).\n\nWhen you can expect counselling\n1. Before you leave the maternity ward (within the first 24–48 hours).  WHO and the Rwanda FP policy recommend that every woman receive FP counselling before discharge. If no one has come yet, feel free to ask the midwife or nurse—your request is welcome.\n2. At your first post-natal visit (within 7 days) and again at the routine 6-week mother-baby check or when the baby receives immunisations.  Health staff will revisit your FP needs at each visit.\n3. Any other time you come to the facility (e.g., for child-immunisation, growth monitoring, or if you simply walk in and ask).  Services are free or very low-cost in public facilities.\n\nWhy counselling is offered early\n• Fertility can return as soon as 4–6 weeks if you are not exclusively breastfeeding, so having a plan before then is important.  \n• Exclusive breastfeeding delays fertility for many women, but only meets the criteria for the Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM) for up to 6 months and only when menses have not yet returned.  \n• Some highly effective methods (e.g., postpartum IUD, implant) can be provided right after birth, before discharge, while others (e.g., combined pills) are started later depending on breastfeeding.\n\nYour rights and options\n• You have the right to ask questions and choose—or decline—any method, regardless of age or marital status.  \n• Counselling must be non-judgmental and confidential.  \n• If you ever feel rushed or not fully informed, you can request more information or a different provider.\n\nWhat you can do now\n• Let the nurse or midwife know you would like FP counselling before you go home.  \n• Think about whether you would like spacing (at least 2 years before the next pregnancy is healthiest for mother and baby) or limiting.  \n• Consider whether you want a method that can be started immediately (e.g., postpartum IUD within 48 hours, implant) or one that can be started later (e.g., injectables, pills, condoms, LAM).  \n• Bring up any medical conditions or medications you have—this helps the provider use the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria to find safe methods for you.\n\nIf you have any doubts or if no one offers counselling before discharge, simply say: “I’d like to talk about family planning before going home.” The team is there to support you.",

Some women prefer to discuss with their partners first, while others choose independently - both are completely acceptable. The most important thing is that you get the method that works best for you and your family goals.",
      "model_response": "It is entirely up to you.  \nHere are some points to consider so you can decide what feels right for you:\n\n1. Your right to confidential services  \n• In Rwanda, every woman—including adolescents and women who are not married—has the legal right to obtain family-planning services without a partner’s or parent’s permission and without extra cost at public facilities.  \n• Health-care workers are trained to provide confidential, non-judgmental care whether you come alone or with someone.\n\n2. Possible advantages of bringing your husband (or another support person)  \n• Shared understanding: Both of you hear the same information about options, how well they work, side-effects, warning signs, and when to seek help.  \n• Support for correct and consistent use: For methods that require partner cooperation (e.g., condoms, fertility awareness) or follow-up visits (e.g., injectable or implant removal), having your husband on board can make use easier.  \n• Joint decision-making: Some couples feel more comfortable choosing a method together, which can strengthen communication.  \n• Reduced misconceptions: He can ask questions directly and receive accurate information from the provider.\n\n3. Possible disadvantages  \n• Privacy: You may feel less free to ask sensitive questions or to choose a method that differs from what he prefers.  \n• Time & logistics: Coordinating schedules can delay your visit or require additional transport costs.  \n• Potential pressure: If you worry that his presence might influence your decision in a way you are not comfortable with, coming alone first might be better.\n\n4. Approaches some clients use  \n• Come alone for the first visit to get information, then return with your husband if you decide you both want more discussion.  \n• Invite him only if you think it will enhance support, especially for methods that need partner cooperation.  \n• Use written or digital information from the clinic to discuss at home if he cannot or prefers not to attend.\n\n5. The provider’s role  \nWhether you come alone or together, the provider should:  \n• Offer balanced counseling on all WHO-approved methods, tailored to your health needs and preferences.  \n• Respect your final choice (autonomy).  \n• Maintain confidentiality.  \n• Address any concerns and explain side-effects, warning signs, and follow-up.\n\n6. When partner involvement is especially helpful (but still not required)  \n• Barrier methods (male or female condoms) – correct use involves both partners.  \n• Fertility awareness methods – daily cooperation is needed.  \n• If you anticipate difficulty attending follow-up visits (e.g., injectables every 3 months, implant removal) and want logistical support.  \n• If you desire dual protection (preventing both pregnancy and HIV/STIs) and need agreement on condom use.\n\nIn summary: You do not have to bring your husband, but you may choose to if you think it will help with communication, support, or method use. Decide what feels safest and most comfortable for you. If you remain unsure, you can always visit a clinic alone first, talk with the provider, and then decide whether to involve him later.",
