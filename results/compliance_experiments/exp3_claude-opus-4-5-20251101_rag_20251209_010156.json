Combined oral contraceptives (pills containing both estrogen and progestin) are not recommended in the first 6 weeks after giving birth while breastfeeding, as they may reduce your milk supply. However, progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills) are safe to use while breastfeeding and won't affect your milk.

      "model_response": "## Answer Based on Available Information\n\nThank you for your question. Based on the guidelines I have access to, here's what I can share:\n\n### Regarding Combined Oral Contraceptives (The Pill):\n\nAccording to the BCS Plus Toolkit, combined oral contraceptives are **not advised** if you:\n\n- Are **within 21 days of giving birth**, regardless of breastfeeding status\n- Are **breastfeeding an infant less than 6 months old**\n\nSince your baby is 3 weeks old (21 days), you are right at the boundary of this timeframe, and you are also breastfeeding an infant under 6 months. Based on these guidelines, **combined oral contraceptives would not be advised** for your current situation.\n\n### Other Options to Discuss:\n\nThe context mentions **Progestin-Only Pills (POPs)**, which are noted as \"very effective during breastfeeding.\" However, I don't have complete information in my available context about the specific timing recommendations for starting POPs after birth.\n\n### My Recommendation:\n\nI encourage you to **speak with a healthcare provider** who can:\n- Assess your complete health history\n- Discuss the full range of contraceptive options suitable for breastfeeding mothers\n- Help you choose a method that fits your needs and circumstances\n\nWould you like information about any other contraceptive methods that might be appropriate during breastfeeding?",

Age is not a medical reason for denying any method to adolescents.\"*\n\nThis means your age (16) is **not** a barrier to using this method.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\nThe guidelines also note that:\n- **Young women may be less tolerant of side effects** than older women\n- Depo-Provera requires an injection every **3 months (13 weeks)**\n\n### What I Cannot Tell You From This Context\n\nI don't have enough information here to advise whether it's the *best* choice **for you specifically**. That depends on factors like:\n- Your health history\n- Your lifestyle and preferences\n- How you might respond to potential side effects\n- Your future pregnancy plans\n\n### My Recommendation\n\nI encourage you to **speak with a healthcare provider** who can:\n1. Discuss all your contraceptive options\n2. Review any personal health considerations\n3. Explain what side effects to expect\n4. Answer your specific questions\n\nYou have the right to accurate information and respectful care regardless of your age. Would you like to know more about any specific aspect of this method?",

A few women may experience sudden weight changes, but these typically reverse after stopping the pills.\n\n**Progestin-Only Injectables (like DMPA):**\nThe evidence is somewhat different for injectable contraceptives. The WHO handbook indicates that women using DMPA gain **an average of 1–2 kg per year**, though some of this may be normal weight gain that occurs with aging. However:\n- Some users lose weight or have no significant change\n- Asian women in particular do not tend to gain weight when using DMPA\n- Individual responses vary considerably\n\n### What This Means for You:\n\n- **Different methods affect people differently** – your experience may not match the average\n- **The pill** is generally not associated with significant weight changes for most women\n- **Injectables** may cause modest weight gain for some users\n\n### My Recommendation:\n\nSince weight concerns are important to you, I'd encourage you to discuss this with a healthcare provider who can:\n- Help you choose a method that fits your priorities\n- Monitor any changes if you're concerned\n- Explore alternatives if needed\n\nWould you like information about any specific contraceptive method?",

However, this is related to the untreated infection itself, not the IUD. This is why:\n- Screening for sexually transmitted infections may be done before insertion\n- Prompt treatment of any infections is important\n- Using condoms can help prevent STIs\n\n### The bottom line:\n\nOnce an IUD is removed, fertility returns promptly.

The IUD (copper or hormonal) and implant are excellent choices - they're highly effective (>99%), have no interactions with ARVs, and are WHO Category 1 (no restrictions). However, some ARVs (especially ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors) can reduce the effectiveness of pills, patch, and ring. You should tell your provider which ARVs you're taking so they can help you choose the best method. Rwanda's integrated FP-HIV services make this easy. Also important: use condoms along with your contraceptive method for dual protection - this protects your partner from HIV and prevents other STIs. You have full access to all contraceptive options.",

      "ground_truth": "You can access contraception with or without your husband - the choice is yours. Rwanda's family planning program encourages partner involvement because discussing family planning together can strengthen couples' decisions. If you'd like to bring your husband, providers can offer couples counseling where you discuss options together. However, you don't need his permission or presence to access contraception. Providers respect your right to make your own decisions about your reproductive health. Some women prefer to discuss with their partners first, while others choose independently - both are completely acceptable. The most important thing is that you get the method that works best for you and your family goals.",
      "model_response": "## Involving Your Husband in Family Planning Decisions\n\nBased on the information provided, here's what I can share:\n\n**Benefits of partner involvement:**\nThe context mentions that \"Men can also use contraception\" and \"Men should be active in parenting and being fathers.\" It also notes that couples can jointly make decisions about family planning, and that spacing children by 24 months benefits the partner's health, children's health, and family resources.\n\n**It's your choice:**\nWhether to bring your husband is entirely **your decision**. Some considerations from the context:\n\n- When husbands are supportive of family planning, couples can work together on method choices\n- Some methods (like condoms, Standard Days Method, or TwoDay Method) require partner cooperation to be effective\n- However, the context also shows that some women seek contraception even when partners are \"not very cooperative\" or \"not supportive of family planning\"\n\n**What this means for you:**\n- If your husband is supportive, involving him may help you both choose a method that works for your relationship\n- If you have concerns about his support, you can still access family planning services on your own\n\n**My recommendation:**\nI don't have enough specific guidance in the context to give you a definitive answer. I'd encourage you to **speak with a healthcare provider** who can discuss your personal situation, relationship dynamics, and help you decide what's most comfortable and safe for you.\n\nIs there anything specific about your situation you'd like to discuss?",
