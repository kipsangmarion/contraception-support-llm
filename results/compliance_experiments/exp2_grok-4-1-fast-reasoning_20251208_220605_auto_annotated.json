Combined oral contraceptives (pills containing both estrogen and progestin) are not recommended in the first 6 weeks after giving birth while breastfeeding, as they may reduce your milk supply. However, progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills) are safe to use while breastfeeding and won't affect your milk. Other good options include the copper IUD, contraceptive implant, or barrier methods like condoms. I'd recommend discussing with your healthcare provider which option works best for you.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for reaching out—it's wonderful that you're thinking about your family planning options while breastfeeding your 3-week-old baby. I'll provide information based on the latest WHO guidelines to help you make an informed choice. Please consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice, as they can assess your full health history.\n\n### Key Considerations for Breastfeeding Women\nAt 3 weeks postpartum and breastfeeding, your eligibility for different types of birth control pills depends on the type:\n\n- **Combined oral contraceptives (COCs, containing estrogen and progestin)**:  \n  **WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) Category 4** (method not recommended—a health risk exists).  \n  These are **not advised** before 6 weeks postpartum for breastfeeding women due to risks like blood clots (venous thromboembolism) and potential reduction in milk supply. After 6 weeks (if fully breastfeeding and up to 6 months postpartum), they are Category 3 (risks usually outweigh benefits—use only if no other options).\n\n- **Progestin-only pills (POPs, also called \"mini-pills\")**:  \n  **WHO MEC Category 1** (no restrictions for use).  \n  These are **safe to start right away**, even at 3 weeks postpartum while breastfeeding. They do not affect milk supply or quality.\n\n### Effectiveness\n- **POPs**: Perfect use: >99% effective; typical use: 91% effective (may be lower if not taken at the same time daily).\n- Must be taken daily at the same time (within 3 hours) for best protection.\n\n### How to Start POPs\n- Can begin immediately (no need to wait for your period).\n- Your provider can prescribe them free or low-cost at public facilities (in places like Rwanda, services are accessible without parental or spousal consent).\n\n### Possible Side Effects of POPs\nCommon (usually improve over time): Irregular bleeding/spotting, headaches, breast tenderness, acne, or mood changes.  \nRare: Ovarian cysts (usually harmless).\n\n### Warning Signs (Seek Care Immediately If...)\n- Severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg swelling/pain (possible blood clot).\n- Heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or yellow skin/eyes (jaundice).\n- Signs of allergic reaction (rash, swelling).\n\n### Other Options to Discuss with Your Provider\nWhile breastfeeding exclusively (and baby <6 months, no periods), you may qualify for the **Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)**: >98% effective if fully breastfeeding on demand, day/night. Combine with a modern method for better protection.  \nSafe alternatives: Progestin-only injectables (e.g., DMPA, MEC 2 early postpartum), implants, IUDs, or condoms.\n\nWhat are your breastfeeding patterns and health concerns? A provider can help choose the best fit for you and your baby. You're in control—let's ensure spacing for your family's health!",

Contraceptive choices during cancer treatment must consider your specific medical situation, treatment type (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy), and recovery stage. Below, I'll outline options based strictly on the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC, 5th edition) for someone with **current breast cancer**.\n\n### Key Guidance from WHO MEC\n- **All hormonal methods** (pills, patches, rings, injections like DMPA, implants, LNG-IUD, hormonal emergency contraception) are **Category 4**: Unacceptable health risk. **Do not use** these, as they may increase risks related to cancer progression or recurrence.\n- **Copper IUD** is **Category 3**: Risks (e.g., infection, bleeding) usually outweigh advantages. Not usually recommended, but could be considered if no other options are suitable/acceptable—discuss urgently with your provider.\n- Safe options (Category 1: no restrictions) focus on **non-hormonal methods**.\n\nAlways use condoms to prevent STIs, regardless of other methods.\n\n### Recommended Contraceptive Options\nHere's a summary of suitable methods, with effectiveness rates from the WHO Family Planning Handbook (2022). Effectiveness varies by perfect use (used correctly/every time) vs. typical use (real-world use).\n\n| Method                  | WHO MEC Category | Perfect Use Effectiveness | Typical Use Effectiveness | Key Pros | Possible Side Effects/Warning Signs | When to Seek Care |\n|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Male/Female Condoms** | 1               | 98-99%                   | 82-87%                   | No hormones; protects against STIs; available over-the-counter; no provider visit needed | Allergy to latex/lubricant; breakage | Return of fever, unusual discharge, pain during sex |\n| **Diaphragm/Cervical Cap (with spermicide)** | 1               | 99%                      | 83-88%                   | No hormones; reusable | UTI risk; spermicide allergy; messy | UTI symptoms, vaginal irritation |\n| **Spermicide alone**   | 1               | 82%                      | 72%                      | No hormones; easy to use | Irritation/allergy; must reapply | Persistent irritation |\n| **Female Sterilization (tubal ligation)** | 1               | >99%                     | >99%                     | Permanent; highly effective | Surgical risks (infection, regret) | Severe pain, heavy bleeding, fever post-procedure |\n| **Male Sterilization (vasectomy)** | 1               | >99%                     | >99%                     | Permanent; simpler procedure | Surgical risks (infection, regret); not immediate | Pain/swelling, signs of infection |\n| **Abstinence/Outercourse** (no penile-vaginal sex) | 1               | 100%                     | 100% (if followed)       | No cost/risks | Requires partner agreement | N/A |\n\n- **Fertility Awareness Methods** (e.g., tracking cycles): Category 1, but less reliable (77-99% perfect; 76% typical). Not ideal during treatment, as chemo/hormonal therapy can disrupt cycles.\n- **Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)**: Only if fully breastfeeding an infant <6 months, no periods returned (effectiveness ~98% perfect). Not applicable otherwise.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Consult your providers immediately**: Share this info with your cancer care team and a family planning clinic. They can check interactions with treatments (e.g., chemo-induced amenorrhea doesn't guarantee infertility).\n- **STI protection**: Use condoms every time you're sexually active.\n- **Return to fertility**: Cancer treatments can affect future fertility—discuss preservation options if relevant.\n- Services are free/low-cost at public facilities in many places, including Rwanda if applicable.\n\nThis is general guidance; your provider will tailor it to you. If you have more details (e.g., treatment type, breastfeeding), I can provide more targeted info from WHO guidelines. Take care.",

This is usually not a major concern for short-term use (under 2 years), and bone density typically returns to normal after stopping. Other methods like the implant or IUD are also very effective and don't have this concern. You might also consider pills or the ring. Would you like to discuss the pros and cons of these options to see which best fits your needs?",
      "model_response": "Depo-Provera (also called DMPA or the injection) can be a suitable option for many adolescents, including those your age, but the best choice depends on your health, preferences, and lifestyle. In Rwanda, you can access family planning services like this without parental consent at age 16, and they're free or low-cost at public health centers. Let's go over the key facts based on WHO guidelines to help you decide.\n\n### Medical Eligibility (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria)\n- For a healthy 16-year-old with no other health issues (like obesity, smoking, or certain chronic conditions), Depo-Provera is **Category 2** for initiation and continuation. This means the benefits usually outweigh the risks, but your provider should screen you first.\n- If you have conditions like severe liver disease, breast cancer history, or uncontrolled high blood pressure, it may not be suitable (Category 3 or 4). Always get checked.\n\n### Effectiveness\n- **Perfect use** (getting shots every 12-13 weeks on time): 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.\n- **Typical use** (with some delays): About 94-96% effective.\n\nIt's a good method if you want something private, long-acting (lasts 3 months per shot), and don't mind injections.\n\n### Benefits\n- No daily pills to remember.\n- Often stops periods after a few months (lighter or no bleeding for many).\n- Reversible—fertility returns quickly after stopping.\n- Doesn't contain estrogen, so safer for those who can't use pills or patches.\n\n### Possible Side Effects and What to Expect\n- Common (affect 1 in 10 or more users):\n  - Irregular spotting or heavy bleeding (first 3-6 months).\n  - No periods (after 1 year, up to 70% of users).\n  - Weight gain (average 2-3 kg in first year).\n  - Headaches, mood changes, or acne.\n- For adolescents: Possible small effect on bone density with long-term use (over 2 years). WHO recommends counseling on this—use the shortest time needed, consider calcium-rich diet/exercise, and switch methods if stopping later.\n- Rare but serious: Allergic reaction to injection, or signs of blood clots (very low risk).\n\n**Warning signs—return to your provider or clinic right away if:**\n- Severe headache, vision changes, or dizziness.\n- Chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg pain/swelling.\n- Heavy bleeding that soaks a pad hourly for several hours.\n- Yellow skin/eyes, severe abdominal pain, or depression.\n\n### Next Steps\nThis is general info—your provider can check your eligibility, give the first shot if suitable, and answer personal questions. Visit a nearby health center or hospital (like in your district). They offer counseling in Kinyarwanda and can discuss alternatives like pills, implants, IUDs, condoms, or emergency contraception.\n\nWhat else are you considering, or do you have health details to share?

Here are WHO MEC options for diabetes with vascular complications (typical use effectiveness in parentheses):\n\n- **Copper IUD (ParaGard)**: Category 1 (safe). Effectiveness: 99% perfect use, 94% typical. Lasts 5–10 years. Possible side effects: heavier periods, cramping. Warning signs: severe pain, heavy bleeding, fever—seek care immediately.\n- **Levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)**: Category 3 (risks may outweigh benefits; use only if no other options). Effectiveness: 99% perfect use, >99% typical. Lasts 5–8 years. Side effects: irregular bleeding initially, possible acne. Warning signs: same as above.\n- **Implant (e.g., Nexplanon)**: Category 2 (generally safe). Effectiveness: 99% perfect use, >99% typical. Lasts 3–5 years. Side effects: irregular bleeding, weight gain possible. Warning signs: severe pain at site, signs of infection.\n- **Progestin-only pills (mini-pills)**: Category 3. Effectiveness: 99% perfect use, 91% typical. Must take at exact time daily. Side effects: irregular bleeding.\n\nNon-hormonal options like condoms (87% typical) or fertility awareness (76% typical) are always available.\n\nYour choice is yours—family planning is personal. In Rwanda, services are free/low-cost at public clinics, and you can access them regardless of age or marital status. Please consult your doctor or a family planning clinic for personalized advice, as I can't assess your specific case. If your diabetes control changes, eligibility may too.",

Safe and effective alternatives include progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, the hormonal IUD (which has only local hormones), or the copper IUD. All of these are highly effective and won't increase your blood clot risk.",
      "model_response": "**No, the birth control patch is not usually recommended for you.**\n\n### Medical Eligibility (WHO MEC Category)\n- The birth control patch is a **combined hormonal contraceptive** (contains estrogen + progestin).\n- With a **history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**, it is **WHO MEC Category 3** (risks usually outweigh advantages).\n  - This applies to past DVT (like yours from 5 years ago), whether or not you are currently on anticoagulants.\n  - **Category 3 means**: Do not use unless other more appropriate methods are unavailable or unacceptable. Your provider may discuss if benefits outweigh risks in your specific case.\n\n### Why the Concern?\n- Estrogen in the patch can increase the risk of blood clots (venous thromboembolism or VTE), including DVT or pulmonary embolism.\n- Your past DVT raises this risk further.\n\n### Effectiveness\n- **Perfect use**: >99% effective at preventing pregnancy.\n- **Typical use**: 91% effective (accounts for real-world use, like changing patch late).\n\n### Common Side Effects\n- Skin irritation, itching, or rash at patch site.\n- Headaches, breast tenderness, nausea, mood changes, or irregular bleeding (often improve after 3 months).\n\n### Warning Signs – Seek Care Immediately If:\n- **Leg pain, swelling, warmth, or redness** (possible DVT).\n- **Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing blood** (possible pulmonary embolism).\n- Severe headache, vision changes, numbness/weakness (possible stroke).\n- Heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or yellow skin/eyes.\n\n### Better Options for You (Safer with DVT History)\nConsider **progestin-only methods** (no estrogen, lower VTE risk):\n- **Progestin-only pill (POP)**: Category 2.\n- **Implant** (e.g., Jadelle): Category 1.\n- **Injection** (e.g., DMPA): Category 1.\n- **Copper or LNG-IUD**: Category 1.\n- **Sterilization** or condoms for non-hormonal choices.\n\nAll methods support informed choice – discuss what fits your life, health, and preferences.\n\n**Please consult a healthcare provider** for a full check (e.g., current risks, exams). They can confirm eligibility and offer free/low-cost options in Rwanda public facilities. In Rwanda, services are available to all, including without partner consent.",

Real-world use is lower because cycles can vary due to stress, illness, travel, or breastfeeding, and it requires daily effort and partner cooperation.\n\n**Key factors for success**:\n- Best for women with regular cycles (26-32 days for Standard Days Method).\n- Requires learning from a trained provider, using tools like cycle beads or apps, and abstaining 8-19 days per cycle (depending on method).\n- No side effects or health risks, but incorrect use can lead to pregnancy.\n\n**When to seek care**:\n- If your cycles are irregular, you're breastfeeding, perimenopausal, or postpartum.\n- Return to a provider if you suspect pregnancy or have questions.\n\nFAMs empower informed choice but may not suit everyone.

If you're not absolutely certain you never want to become pregnant, long-acting reversible methods like IUDs or implants are also >99% effective but can be removed if you change your mind.

      "model_response": "No, tubal ligation (also called \"getting your tubes tied\") is a highly effective permanent method of contraception designed to prevent pregnancy by blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes so eggs cannot meet sperm. However, it is not 100% effective—pregnancy is possible but extremely rare.\n\n### Effectiveness (per WHO data):\n- **Perfect use**: >99% effective (failure rate <0.5% in the first year; cumulative 10-year failure rate around 0.5–1.8%, depending on the surgical method).\n- **Typical use**: Similar to perfect use, as it relies on a one-time procedure rather than ongoing user action.\n\nIf pregnancy occurs after tubal ligation, it is more likely to be ectopic (outside the uterus), which is a medical emergency requiring immediate care.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Permanence**: This is intended to be permanent. Reversal is possible but complex, expensive, not always successful, and not guaranteed to restore fertility.\n- **Eligibility**: Suitable for most women (WHO MEC Category 1 or 2 for nearly all conditions post-partum or interval). Discuss your health history with a provider to confirm.\n- **Side effects and risks**: Surgical risks (infection, bleeding, anesthesia issues), pain, or regret. No monthly side effects like with hormonal methods. Warning signs: severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, fever, or signs of ectopic pregnancy (e.g., one-sided pain, shoulder pain)—seek care immediately.\n- **No protection from STIs**: Use condoms for STI prevention.\n\nThis is a big decision—think about your future family plans. A healthcare provider can counsel you fully, check eligibility, and discuss alternatives like implants (99%+ effective) or IUDs. Services are often free/low-cost at public facilities.

Here's guidance based on WHO recommendations (always confirm with a healthcare provider for your specific health needs):\n\n#### **Key Starting Times**\n- **If you have regular periods**:\n  - **Days 1–5 of your cycle** (Day 1 = first day of bleeding): Start immediately. You're protected right away—no backup needed.\n  - **After Day 5**: Start anytime, but use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) for the **first 7 days**.\n  \n- **If you have no periods** (e.g., breastfeeding, postpartum, or amenorrhea):\n  - Start anytime, but use backup for **7 days**. First, rule out pregnancy with a test or exam.\n\n- **After childbirth**:\n  - Not breastfeeding: Wait until **21 days postpartum**, then start (backup for 7 days).\n  - Breastfeeding: Wait at least **6 weeks**, ensure baby is mostly or fully breastfed, then start (backup for 7 days). COCs are generally safe for breastfeeding after 6 weeks (WHO MEC Category 2).\n\n- **After abortion or miscarriage**:\n  - Start **immediately**—you're protected right away.\n\nTake 1 pill daily at the same time for 21 days (or as per pack instructions), followed by a hormone-free interval or placebo pills. Start a new pack after the break.\n\n#### **Effectiveness**\n- **Perfect use**: 99% (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 women/year).\n- **Typical use**: 91% (9 pregnancies per 100 women/year, often due to missed pills).\n\n#### **Common Side Effects**\n- Nausea, breast tenderness, spotting, mood changes, headaches (usually improve after 3 months).\n- No protection against STIs—use condoms for that.\n\n#### **Warning Signs (Seek Care Immediately—\"ACHES\")**\n- **A**rm pain, numbness, or weakness (blood clot).\n- **C**hest pain, shortness of breath (lung clot/heart issue).\n- **H**eadache (severe/new), dizziness, vision changes (stroke risk).\n- **E**ye problems (vision loss).\n- **S**evere leg pain/swelling (blood clot).\nAlso: Heavy bleeding, yellow skin/eyes (liver issues), or missed period (possible pregnancy).\n\n#### **Next Steps**\nIn Rwanda, pills are free or low-cost at public health centers—no consent needed regardless of age or marital status. Visit a clinic for a free check-up, supply, and personalized advice (they'll screen for eligibility using WHO MEC). If you have health conditions (e.g., smoking over 35, high blood pressure), some may not be suitable—don't guess, consult a provider.\n\nWhat else can I help with, like other methods or your situation?

Take the missed pill **right now**, then resume daily at the usual time.\n2. Use backup or avoid sex for **48 hours** after the missed dose.\n3. Consider EC if unprotected sex occurred in the **past 5 days**.\n\n### For both types:\n- **Side effects of catching up**: Possible mild nausea or spotting—usually short-term.\n- **Warning signs to seek care immediately** (go to a clinic or call emergency services): Severe chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain/swelling, severe headache/vision changes, or heavy bleeding.\n- **Next steps**: Use a backup method until you're back on track. If you've had sex or are unsure, get EC from a pharmacy/clinic (no prescription needed in Rwanda; available free at public facilities). Test for pregnancy if your period is >1 week late.\n- Adolescents and unmarried women have full access without consent in Rwanda—services are confidential.\n\nThis keeps your options open while protecting your health.

      "model_response": "You can switch from the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) to either a copper IUD (Cu-IUD) or levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD, such as Mirena) safely and effectively. Here's guidance based on WHO recommendations to ensure you're protected right away:\n\n### Recommended Timing for IUD Insertion\n- **Ideal time**: Schedule insertion **during the first 7 days of your menstrual period** (starting from the first day of bleeding). This confirms you're not pregnant, makes insertion easier (cervix is softer), and provides **immediate contraceptive protection** with **no need for backup methods**.\n- **Anytime option**: If you prefer, the IUD can be inserted **at any time in your cycle** if it's reasonably certain you're **not pregnant** (e.g., you've been taking the pill consistently and correctly, with no missed pills, vomiting, or other issues in the past month). \n  - Stop the pill on the day of insertion or the day before.\n  - Use a **backup method** (like condoms) for **7 days** after insertion if it's more than 7 days since your last menstrual bleeding started.\n\nYour provider will do a quick pregnancy check (e.g., questions about your cycle, pill use, or a urine test) before inserting.\n\n### Effectiveness\n| Method | Perfect Use | Typical Use |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| COC (pill) | 99% | 91% |\n| Cu-IUD | >99% | >99% |\n| LNG-IUD | >99% | >99% |\n\nIUDs are among the most effective long-term options (Cu-IUD lasts 5–12 years; LNG-IUD 5–8 years, depending on type).\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Contact a provider**: Visit a public health center or clinic in Rwanda (services are free or low-cost). No parental or spousal consent needed.\n2. **Discuss eligibility**: Most women qualify (WHO MEC category 1 or 2 for IUDs if healthy), but tell your provider about any medical history (e.g., infections, anemia, breast cancer). They'll check.\n3. **What to expect**: Insertion takes 5–10 minutes, may cause cramping (like strong period pain). Take ibuprofen beforehand if needed.\n\n### Common Side Effects and Warning Signs\n- **Cu-IUD**: Heavier, longer, or more painful periods (may improve after 3–6 months).\n- **LNG-IUD**: Lighter or no periods, spotting (common first 3–6 months).\n- **All IUDs**: Cramping, backache, or spotting for a few days/weeks post-insertion.\n- **Seek care immediately** if: Severe pain/fever >38°C (possible infection), heavy bleeding soaking >2 pads/hour, expulsion (IUD falls out—check strings monthly), missed period with prior regular cycles, or signs of pregnancy.\n\nThis supports your informed choice—great job planning ahead! Consult a trained provider for personalized advice, as they can confirm the best timing for you.",

Effectiveness rates are from WHO data:\n\n| Method | Perfect Use | Typical Use | Key Pros | Common Side Effects/Warnings | When to Seek Care |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Implant** (e.g., etonogestrel, 3-5 yrs) | >99.9% | >99.9% | Long-acting, reversible, low maintenance | Irregular bleeding, headaches, acne | Heavy bleeding >7 days, severe pain, leg swelling |\n| **IUD (Copper, 5-10 yrs)** | >99% | >99% | Hormone-free, long-acting, emergency option | Heavier periods, cramping | Pain/fever after insertion, heavy bleeding |\n| **IUD (Hormonal/LNG, 3-8 yrs)** | >99% | >99% | Lighter periods, long-acting | Irregular spotting (first months), cramps | Same as above + mood changes |\n| **Injection** (e.g., DMPA, every 3 months) | >99% | 96% | No daily action, reduces cramps | Irregular bleeding, weight gain, delayed fertility return | Bone density concerns long-term; return after 2+ yrs |\n| **Pill** (combined or progestin-only, daily) | 99% | 91% | Regulates cycles, reduces cramps/acne | Nausea, spotting, breast tenderness | Chest pain, leg swelling, severe headache (stroke risk) |\n| **Patch/Ring/Vaginal** | 99% | 91% | Weekly/monthly options | Similar to pill | Same as pill |\n| **Condoms (male/female)** | 98% (male)/95% (female) | 82-87% | STI protection, no hormones | None major | Allergy to latex |\n| **Fertility Awareness** (tracking cycles) | 99% (with app/tech) | 76% | Hormone-free, natural | Requires daily tracking | Not for irregular cycles |\n| **Lactational Amenorrhea** (if breastfeeding) | 98% (first 6 months) | Varies | Natural if exclusive breastfeeding | Only short-term | When menses return |\n\nAll methods have warning signs (e.g., \"ACHE\" for hormonal: Abdominal pain, Chest pain, Headache, Eye issues, Leg pain—seek care immediately). No method is 100% effective, and combining with condoms adds STI protection.\n\nOnce I know more about you, I can narrow this down or check eligibility. Ultimately, the choice is yours—what appeals most? I recommend visiting a clinic for a free check-up and method if possible (e.g., public health centers in Rwanda offer this).

A healthcare provider can check for any individual factors.\n- **Effectiveness** (examples for common methods):\n  | Method              | Perfect Use | Typical Use |\n  |---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n  | Implant             | >99%       | >99%       |\n  | IUD (hormonal/copper)| >99%      | >99%       |\n  | Pill                | 99%        | 91%        |\n  | Condom (male)       | 98%        | 82%        |\n  | Injection           | 99%        | 94%        |\n\n- **Benefits**: Delays pregnancy until you're ready, reduces risks like anemia or complications from early pregnancy, and condoms also protect against STIs.\n- **Side effects and warnings**: Vary by method (e.g., irregular bleeding with IUD/implant, headaches with pills). Common warning signs include severe pain, heavy bleeding, leg swelling, or chest pain—seek care immediately if these occur.\n- **No method is 100%**: Combine methods (e.g., condoms + pills) for extra protection.\n\n### Your Rights and Next Steps\nIf you're in Rwanda, you can access free or low-cost family planning services at public health centers without parental consent, regardless of marital status. Services are confidential and respectful.\n\nI encourage you to talk to a trained family planning provider—they'll help you explore options based on your needs, answer questions, and ensure the best fit.

Here's some general information based on WHO guidelines to help you make an informed choice:\n\n### Key Facts Before Stopping\n- **Fertility returns quickly**: For most methods (pills, patch, ring, injection), you can ovulate and get pregnant within days to weeks after stopping. For implants or IUDs, it may take a bit longer, but it's unpredictable.\n- **No method is 100% effective except abstinence**. If avoiding pregnancy is your top priority, consider combining methods or using highly effective options.\n\n### Non-Hormonal Options to Prevent Pregnancy\nHere are reliable alternatives without hormones. Effectiveness varies by perfect use (done exactly right every time) vs. typical use (real-world use):\n\n| Method | Perfect Use Effectiveness | Typical Use Effectiveness | Pros | Cons/Side Effects | Warning Signs (Seek Care If...) |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Male Condoms** | 98% | 82-87% | Protects against STIs, no prescription needed, available over-the-counter | Can break/slip, may reduce sensation | Allergy to latex, signs of STI |\n| **Female Condoms** | 95% | 79% | Protects against STIs, inserted by you | Noisy, harder to insert | Discomfort or irritation |\n| **Copper IUD** (non-hormonal) | >99% | >99% | Long-term (up to 10+ years), reversible, works right away | Heavier periods/cramps (especially first months) | Severe pain, heavy bleeding, fever/infection signs |\n| **Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM)** (tracking cycle, cervical mucus, temp) | 91-99% (with app/training) | 76% | No devices/hormones, empowers cycle knowledge | Requires daily tracking, training; less effective if cycles irregular (e.g., breastfeeding, perimenopause) | N/A—combine with barriers for better protection |\n| **Withdrawal (pull-out)** | 96% | 78% | No cost/supplies | Requires partner control; pre-ejaculate can cause pregnancy; no STI protection | N/A |\n| **Abstinence** (no penile-vaginal sex) | 100% | 100% | Fully effective | May not fit lifestyle | N/A |\n| **Spermicide** (alone) | 82% | 72% | Easy to use | Irritation possible; not for STI protection | Allergy or irritation |\n\n- **Emergency Contraception (EC)**: If unprotected sex happens, use within 5 days (ulipristal acetate best up to 120 hours; levonorgestrel up to 72 hours). Effectiveness: 85-95% if timely. Not for routine use—see a provider or pharmacy.\n- **Dual Protection**: Use condoms + another method (e.g., FAM) for better effectiveness and STI prevention.\n\n### What to Do Next\n1. **See a provider soon**: They can rule out any health issues (using WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria) and offer free/low-cost options. In Rwanda, services are available without parental/spousal consent, even for adolescents.\n2. **Track your cycle**: Start now with an app or calendar to understand your fertile days.\n3. **Plan with partner**: Discuss and practice methods together.\n4. **When to seek care urgently**: Severe pain, unusual bleeding, or pregnancy symptoms.\n\nYou're in control—choose what fits your life.

IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication.

There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low.

      "model_response": "I understand your friend's experience might be concerning—everyone's body reacts differently, and it's great you're seeking more information to make an informed choice.\n\n### On Pain with IUD Insertion\n- Insertion usually takes just a few minutes and feels like strong menstrual cramps for most people. Some describe it as uncomfortable or briefly painful, but it's typically over quickly.\n- Pain can be managed: Many providers offer local anesthesia (like a numbing injection), pain relievers (e.g., ibuprofen beforehand), or cervical blocks. Discuss options with your provider in advance.\n- After insertion, cramping may last 1-2 days and can be eased with rest and meds.\n\n### On Infections\n- The risk of infection (like pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID) is **very low** overall—less than 1% for most users. The highest risk is in the first 3 weeks after insertion, especially if you have an undiagnosed STI.\n- Providers screen for STIs before insertion and follow sterile procedures to minimize this. Long-term, IUDs **do not increase infection risk** and may even protect against some upper genital tract infections.\n- If you have active PID, recent STI, or certain risk factors, it may not be suitable (per WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria—check your eligibility with a provider).\n\n### Effectiveness and Other Key Facts (Copper IUD or Hormonal/LNG-IUD)\n| Method | Perfect Use | Typical Use |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Copper IUD | >99% | 99.2-99.4% |\n| LNG-IUD | >99% | 99.8% |\n\n- **Lasts 5-12 years** depending on type; reversible and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n- **Common side effects**: Heavier periods/cramping (copper); lighter/irregular bleeding (LNG, especially first 3-6 months).\n- **Warning signs** (seek care immediately if): Severe pain, heavy bleeding soaking >2 pads/hour, fever/chills, foul vaginal discharge, or missed period (for LNG).\n\nIUDs are safe and effective for most healthy women, including adolescents and those who haven't given birth (WHO MEC category 1-2 for most). In Rwanda, they're free or low-cost at public health centers, and you can access them without parental/spousal consent regardless of marital status.\n\nThe best next step is to talk with a trained family planning provider—they'll assess your health, answer personal questions, and help compare options like pills, injectables, implants, or condoms.

      "ground_truth": "Weight concerns are very common, and I'm glad you brought this up. Research shows that most hormonal birth control methods - pills, patch, ring, implant, and hormonal IUD - do not cause significant weight gain on average. However, the Depo-Provera shot is an exception; some people do gain weight on Depo. Everyone's body is different, so individual experiences vary. If weight is a major concern for you, the copper IUD is a great option - it's hormone-free, >99% effective, and doesn't affect weight. Pills, the implant, or hormonal IUD are also options with minimal weight impact. Would you like to hear more about these methods?",
      "model_response": "I understand your concern—weight gain is a common worry with birth control, and it's important to address it openly.\n\n### What the evidence shows (from WHO guidelines):\n- **Most methods do not cause significant weight gain.** Studies, including those in the WHO Family Planning Handbook, show that for combined oral contraceptives (pills), patches, and rings, any weight change is usually minimal (less than 2 kg) and often due to water retention or lifestyle factors, not the method itself. It tends to stabilize after a few months.\n- **Progestin-only injectables (like DMPA/Depo-Provera)** have the strongest link to weight gain—about 2-5 kg on average in the first year for some users, though not everyone experiences it. The WHO notes this as a possible side effect.\n- **Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like implants (e.g., Jadelle or Implanon) and IUDs (copper or hormonal like Mirena)** have little to no proven association with weight gain.\n- Factors like diet, exercise, age, and genetics play a bigger role in weight changes than birth control for most people.\n\n### Your options:\nWe can help you choose based on your health and preferences. Here's a quick overview (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria rates all methods safe—category 1 or 2—for most people without obesity concerns):\n\n| Method | Perfect Use Effectiveness | Typical Use Effectiveness | Weight Gain Risk |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| **Implant** | >99% | >99% | Low |\n| **IUD (hormonal or copper)** | >99% | >99% | Low |\n| **Pill (combined)** | >99% | 91% | Low/minimal |\n| **Injectable (DMPA)** | >99% | 94% | Moderate |\n| **Condoms** | 98% | 82% | None |\n\n### What to do next:\n- **Track your weight** if you start a method—many find it stabilizes with healthy eating and activity.\n- **Side effects to watch for:** Any method can cause irregular bleeding, mood changes, or headaches initially. For weight gain, return if it's rapid or concerning.\n- **Seek care if:** Sudden weight gain with swelling, shortness of breath, or chest pain (rare but serious—could signal other issues).\n\nEveryone's body is different, so the best step is a visit to your local health center (free/low-cost in Rwanda). A provider can review your health history, check eligibility, and help pick what fits you. What other questions do you have, or which methods interest you? I'm here to support your choice without judgment.",

      "model_response": "It's completely understandable that remembering a daily pill can be challenging—many people face this, and it's great that you're reaching out to find a better option.

No backup needed.\n- **More than 12 hours late**:\n  | Days 1-7 | Days 8-14 | Days 15+ (pill-free or placebo week) |\n  |----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n  | Take missed pill now + next one on time.

Backup for 7 days if >1 missed. | Take missed pill now. No backup if pack ends correctly, but omit placebo week if >1 missed and start new pack early. |\n\nIf you've missed multiple or are unsure, use condoms or abstain until you see a provider, and consider EC (within 5 days of unprotected sex—effective up to 99% if taken promptly).\n\n### Long-term options to consider:\nSince forgetting is ongoing, a method that doesn't rely on daily memory might suit you better. Here's a non-judgmental overview of highly effective alternatives (all WHO MEC Category 1 or 2 for most healthy women—confirm your eligibility with a provider):\n\n| Method | Perfect Use Failure | Typical Use Failure | Key Pros | Common Side Effects/Warnings |\n|--------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|------------------------------|\n| **Implant** (e.g., Jadelle or Implanon, lasts 3-5 yrs) | 0.05% | 0.05% | \"Set it and forget it\"; reversible; Rwanda free at public clinics. | Irregular bleeding (first 6-12 months), headaches; rare insertion issues. Return if severe pain/swelling at site. |\n| **IUD** (Copper: 10 yrs; Hormonal: 5 yrs) | 0.1-0.8% | 0.1-0.8% | Long-term, highly effective; no hormones (copper). Free/low-cost in Rwanda. | Cramping/spotting initially; heavier periods (copper). Seek care for pain/fever/odd discharge (infection risk). |\n| **3-month Injection** (e.g., Depo-Provera) | 0.2% | 4% | Every 3 months; private. | Irregular bleeding, weight gain; return fertility delay (up to 1 yr). Check for bone density if long-term. |\n| **Progestin-Only Pill** | 0.3% | 9% | No estrogen; but still daily—may not solve forgetting. | Irregular bleeding. |\n\nAll methods have possible side effects like bleeding changes—most improve over time. Warning signs for any: severe abdominal pain, chest pain/shortness of breath, heavy bleeding, or leg swelling (seek care immediately).\n\nIn Rwanda, family planning is free at public health centers (no consent needed if over 18, or even for adolescents). Visit your nearest facility for free counseling, eligibility check (via WHO MEC), and method switch—they'll respect your choices without judgment.\n\nWhat are your family planning goals (e.g., spacing births, limiting family)? Any health concerns (e.g., smoking, breastfeeding)? This helps tailor advice—otherwise, consult a provider soon for personalized support. You're taking a positive step!",

Long-acting, reversible. |\n| **IUD (Copper or Hormonal, 5-12 years)** | >99% | >99% | Provider-inserted; highly effective. Copper: heavier periods. Hormonal: lighter periods. Warning: pelvic pain, fever—see provider ASAP. |\n| **Injection** (every 3 months) | >99% | 94% | Provider-given. Side effects: irregular bleeding, weight gain. |\n| **Emergency Contraception** (pills like ulipristal acetate within 5 days of unprotected sex) | 99% (if soon after) | Varies | Backup option; doesn't protect ongoing. Not for routine use. |\n\nAll methods are WHO MEC Category 1 (no restrictions) for most healthy adults—confirm with a provider based on your health history.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **See a healthcare provider soon** for free/low-cost counseling, method fitting, and personalized advice (e.g., at public clinics). They can discuss your situation confidentially—no parental/partner consent needed for adults/adolescents.\n- Combine methods (e.g., pills + condoms) for extra protection against sabotage.\n- **Warning signs for any method**: Severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, signs of infection—return to clinic immediately.\n- If you suspect reproductive coercion, talk to a trusted provider or counselor for support resources.\n\nWhat questions do you have about these options, or do you want more details on one?

The best choice depends on your health, preferences, and lifestyle—talk to a provider for personalized advice using WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC).\n\n### Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) – Highly discreet, last years\nThese are inserted by a provider and you don't need to think about them daily.\n\n- **Implant (e.g., Jadelle or Implanon NXT, 3-5 years)**  \n  Effectiveness: >99% (perfect and typical use).  \n  Pros: Very effective, private (small arm implant, often not visible), reversible.  \n  Common side effects: Irregular bleeding, headaches, acne (usually improve over time).  \n  Warning signs (seek care immediately): Severe pain/swelling at insertion site, heavy bleeding, signs of infection (fever, pus).  \n  MEC for healthy adolescents: Category 1 (no restrictions).\n\n- **Intrauterine Device (IUD, e.g., copper or LNG-IUD like Mirena, 5-10+ years)**  \n  Effectiveness: >99% (perfect), 99-100% (typical).  \n  Pros: Long-term, private once inserted.  \n  Common side effects: Cramping first few months, heavier periods (copper) or lighter (hormonal).  \n  Warning signs: Severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding soaking >2 pads/hour, fever, foul discharge.  \n  MEC for healthy adolescents: Category 1-2 (check for anemia or infections).\n\n### Injectables – Discreet visits every 3 months\n- **Depo-Provera (DMPA) injection**  \n  Effectiveness: 99% perfect use, 94% typical use.  \n  Pros: No daily action, private clinic visits.  \n  Common side effects: Irregular bleeding, weight gain, mood changes (may improve).  \n  Warning signs: Severe headache/vision changes, leg pain/swelling (blood clot risk), jaundice.  \n  MEC for healthy adolescents: Category 1.\n\n### Other Options\n- **Monthly pill or patch**: Effectiveness 99% perfect, 91% typical. Discreet if hidden, but daily/weekly routine might be noticed.  \n- **Condoms (male/female)**: 98% perfect, 82% typical. Available over-the-counter at pharmacies—no provider needed, fully private.\n\nAll methods have return to fertility after stopping (quick for most). No method protects against STIs—use condoms for that.\n\n**Next steps**: Visit a nearby health center (find one via 114 or Rwanda Biomedical Center app). They'll counsel you confidentially, check eligibility, and provide what suits you. If you have health conditions (e.g., migraines, smoking), mention them for safety.\n\nWhat else can I help with, like specific side effects or finding a clinic? Always consult a provider for your situation.",

      "ground_truth": "No, you don't need to take a break from the pill. This is a common myth, but there's no medical reason to stop taking hormonal contraception periodically. Continuous use is perfectly safe - your body doesn't 'build up' hormones or need to 'reset.' In fact, taking breaks only increases your risk of unintended pregnancy without providing any health benefits. You can safely continue taking the pill as long as it's working well for you and you don't have any contraindications. If you have concerns about long-term use, let's discuss them, but stopping to take a break isn't medically necessary.",
      "model_response": "No, you do not need to take a break from the combined oral contraceptive pill (often called \"the pill\") after 3 years or any specific time. According to the 2022 WHO Family Planning Global Handbook and WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), there is no evidence-based recommendation for routine breaks from the pill. Long-term use is safe and effective for most women who have no medical contraindications (typically rated MEC 1 or 2 for continuation).\n\n### Why no break is needed:\n- Myths about needing to \"rest your ovaries\" or take periodic breaks are not supported by evidence. Continuing the pill protects against pregnancy without harming future fertility.\n- Effectiveness remains high: **Perfect use: 99%** (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 women per year); **typical use: 91%** (9 pregnancies per 100 women per year).\n\n### Things to consider for continuing:\n- **Check your eligibility**: Review your health with a provider. Conditions like smoking over age 35, high blood pressure, or certain migraines may change eligibility (MEC 3 or 4—consult a clinician).\n- **Common side effects**: Lighter periods, spotting, breast tenderness, mood changes, or nausea (often improve after 3 months). No periods is normal and safe.\n- **Warning signs** (seek care immediately if you experience):\n  - Severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg swelling (possible blood clot).\n  - Sudden severe headache, vision changes, or numbness (possible stroke).\n  - Heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or yellow skin/eyes (jaundice).\n- **Benefits**: Reduces risks of ovarian/endometrial cancer, heavy periods, and anemia.\n\nIt's your choice to continue, switch methods, or stop—whatever best fits your life and health goals. I recommend a check-up with your healthcare provider to confirm it's still right for you, discuss any concerns, and get a fresh supply. In Rwanda, services are free/low-cost at public facilities, and you can access care without restrictions based on age or marital status.\n\nIf you share more about your health or reasons for asking, I can provide more tailored info based on WHO guidelines.",

Absolute risk remains low for most women.\n- **Cervical cancer**: Long-term use (5+ years) may slightly increase risk, especially if screening is irregular, but this is not fully proven and returns to normal after stopping.\n- **Protective effects**: COCs *decrease* the risk of ovarian cancer (by ~30% with 5+ years use) and endometrial cancer (by ~50% with 5+ years use). These benefits last for decades after stopping.\n- **Overall**: For most healthy women, the benefits (including highly effective pregnancy prevention: 99% with perfect use, 91% typical use) outweigh risks. Progestin-only pills (POPs) have even less association with breast cancer risk.\n\n### WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC):\n- If you have no history of breast cancer or other risk factors: Category 1 or 2 (generally safe to use).\n- Current breast cancer: Category 4 (unacceptable risk—do not use).\n- Past breast cancer (<5 years): Category 3 or 4 (risks usually outweigh benefits).\n\n### What to Do Next:\n- **See a provider**: They can review your health history, family risks, and recommend options (e.g., IUDs, implants, or POPs may have different profiles).\n- **Warning signs** (for any method): Unexplained breast lumps, abnormal bleeding, severe headaches, or leg pain—seek care immediately.\n- **Side effects** (common for COCs): Nausea, spotting, mood changes, breast tenderness—often improve after 3 months.\n\nAll methods have pros/cons; the best choice fits *your* needs and health.

Effectiveness is highest when used as soon as possible (85-89% typical use).\n- For ongoing protection, talk to a healthcare provider about effective methods like condoms (98% perfect use, 82% typical), pills (99% perfect/91% typical), implants (99% both), or IUDs.

Let me explain based on WHO guidelines.\n\n### Natural/Fertility Awareness Methods (e.g., calendar/rhythm, sympto-thermal, cervical mucus, basal body temperature)\n- **How they work**: Track your menstrual cycle, fertile signs (like mucus, temperature), or cycle length to avoid unprotected sex on fertile days (usually 8-19 days before next period).\n- **Effectiveness** (WHO data):\n  | Method | Perfect use (failure rate) | Typical use (failure rate) |\n  |--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n  | Sympto-thermal (tracks multiple signs) | 0.4% (99.6% effective) | 1.8-12% (88-98% effective) |\n  | Calendar/rhythm | 1-9% (91-99% effective) | 12-24% (76-88% effective) |\n- **Pros**: No hormones, no side effects, low cost, empowers cycle knowledge.\n- **Cons/Limitations**:\n  - Less effective than modern methods (e.g., pills: 7% typical failure; IUD: <1%).\n  - Requires daily tracking, partner cooperation, and abstinence or condoms on fertile days (about 10-17 days/cycle).\n  - Not suitable if cycles are irregular (e.g., breastfeeding, postpartum, perimenopause, stress, illness).\n  - No protection from STIs.\n- **Side effects/Warning signs**: None from method itself, but see a provider if cycles change suddenly, unusual bleeding, pain, or pregnancy signs.\n- **Tips for success**: Use apps/tools trained by a provider; combine methods (e.g., mucus + temperature). Rwanda clinics offer free counseling/training.\n\n### Withdrawal (Pull-Out Method)\n- **How it works**: Penis withdrawn before ejaculation.\n- **Effectiveness**: Perfect use 4% failure (96% effective); typical 20-22% (78-80% effective).\n- **Pros/Cons**: Easy, no cost/supplies; but pre-ejaculate can contain sperm, needs partner trust/skill.\n- **Warning signs**: Same as above.\n\n### Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) – If breastfeeding\n- Exclusive breastfeeding (no formula/foods/liquids) delays ovulation.\n- Effectiveness: 98% if under 6 months postpartum, no periods, fully breastfeeding day/night.\n- Switch to another method when criteria fail.\n\n### Herbal Supplements/Natural Remedies (e.g., neem, papaya, wild carrot)\n- **WHO stance**: No evidence they prevent pregnancy reliably or safely. Not tested for effectiveness; can cause toxicity, hormone disruption, interactions with meds, or harm (e.g., liver/kidney damage).\n- **Risks**: Unregulated doses/quality; may delay diagnosis of pregnancy issues.\n- **Recommendation**: Avoid for contraception—use proven methods instead.\n\nAll methods respect your choice, but natural ones have higher unintended pregnancy risk (12-25% per year typical use). Compare options with a provider for your health (WHO MEC checks eligibility—most are category 1-2). In Rwanda, free/low-cost services at health centers—no consent needed regardless of age/marital status. What else can I clarify to help you decide? Consult a provider for personalized advice.",

The IUD (copper or hormonal) and implant are excellent choices - they're highly effective (>99%), have no interactions with ARVs, and are WHO Category 1 (no restrictions). However, some ARVs (especially ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors) can reduce the effectiveness of pills, patch, and ring. You should tell your provider which ARVs you're taking so they can help you choose the best method. Rwanda's integrated FP-HIV services make this easy. Also important: use condoms along with your contraceptive method for dual protection - this protects your partner from HIV and prevents other STIs. You have full access to all contraceptive options.",
      "model_response": "Thank you for sharing your situation—it's great that you're on ARVs and thinking about family planning. In Rwanda, all women living with HIV have equal access to free or low-cost contraceptive services at public health facilities, regardless of marital status, and you can get counseling and methods without needing partner consent. Services follow WHO guidelines and the Rwanda National Family Planning Policy (2021).\n\nMost contraceptive methods are safe for women living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), but **some ARV regimens (like those containing efavirenz) can reduce the effectiveness of certain hormonal methods**. Your specific ART matters, so **please consult your healthcare provider or a family planning clinic** to check eligibility based on your CD4 count, viral load, ART drugs, and health status. They can do a quick eligibility check using WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC).\n\nHere's a summary of key methods, their WHO MEC categories for HIV+ women on ART (generally asymptomatic), typical/perfect use effectiveness, side effects, and warning signs. Categories: **1** = no restrictions; **2** = advantages usually outweigh risks; **3** = risks usually outweigh advantages (not usually recommended); **4** = unacceptable health risk.\n\n### Highly Effective Methods (Long-Acting Reversible Contraception - LARCs and Permanent)\n| Method | WHO MEC for HIV+ on ART | Effectiveness (Typical/Perfect Use) | Common Side Effects | Warning Signs (Seek Care Immediately If...) |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Implant** (e.g., Jadelle or Implanon, 3-5 years) | 1-3* (1 for most ART; 3 if efavirenz) | 99%/99% | Irregular bleeding, headaches, acne | Severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, leg pain/swelling, chest pain, jaundice |\n| **DMPA Injection** (every 3 months) | **1** (safe for all ART) | 94%/99% | Irregular bleeding, weight gain, mood changes | Same as above; bone density concerns with long-term use |\n| **Copper IUD** (5-10 years) | **1** (asymptomatic) or **2** (symptomatic HIV) | 99%/99% | Heavier periods, cramping | Severe pain/fever after insertion, unusual discharge, heavy bleeding |\n| **Levonorgestrel IUD (LNG-IUD)** (5 years) | **1-2** | 99%/99% | Lighter periods (over time), spotting | Same as copper IUD |\n| **Female Sterilization** (permanent) | **1** | 99%/99% | Pain/cramping post-procedure | Severe pain, infection signs, heavy bleeding |\n| **Vasectomy** (male partner, permanent) | **1** | 99%/99% | Minor swelling | Infection, persistent pain |\n\n*Implants/Pills may be less effective with efavirenz—use condoms as backup.\n\n### Moderate Effectiveness Methods\n| Method | WHO MEC | Effectiveness | Side Effects | Warning Signs |\n|--------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Combined Oral Pills (COC)** or Patch/Ring | **1-2** (2 with efavirenz) | 91%/99% | Nausea, breast tenderness, spotting | Leg pain/swelling, severe headache, chest pain, vision changes |\n| **Progestin-Only Pills (POP)** | **1-3** (3 with efavirenz) | 91%/99% | Irregular bleeding | Same as COCs |\n| **Male/Female Condoms** (dual protection vs. STIs/HIV) | **1** (always recommended) | 82%/98% (male); 79%/95% (female) | None major | Allergic reaction to latex |\n| **Fertility Awareness** (e.g., Standard Days) | **1** | 76%/98% | None | - |\n\n### Short-Term or Natural Methods\n- **Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)**: WHO 1 if fully breastfeeding <6 months, no periods. Effectiveness 98%/98% perfect use. Transition to another method after.\n- **Emergency Contraception** (pills like ulipristal): WHO 1. Use within 72-120 hours after unprotected sex.\n\n**Key Advice**:\n- **Condoms are essential** for everyone living with HIV to prevent STIs and partner transmission—combine with another method for best pregnancy protection.\n- No method protects 100%—choose based on your lifestyle, future plans, and preferences.\n- Side effects often improve after 3 months; discuss management with your provider.\n- Return visits: As scheduled for method (e.g., DMPA every 3 months).\n- In Rwanda, visit a health center, hospital",

Services are confidential and provided with respect.\n\nI encourage you to visit your nearest public health facility to discuss options that suit your health and preferences. A provider can assess eligibility, explain effectiveness (e.g., implants are over 99% effective with perfect use), side effects, and warning signs. If you have any health conditions, they follow WHO guidelines to ensure safety.",
