If pregnancy cannot be ruled out at the first visit, the shot can still be given, but you will need a back-up method (such as condoms) for the next 7 days.

It is helpful to discuss possible changes in bleeding patterns, weight, or other effects so you know what to expect.  \n• Privacy and convenience: Many adolescents like the shot because it is private and only needed four times a year.  \n• Other options: Every method—pills, implants, IUDs, condoms, etc.—is also considered safe for young people. Comparing methods can help you pick what feels best.\n\nNext steps  \n• Talk with a trained health-care provider.

Your age (25 years) does not, by itself, limit your options. “Age alone does not restrict a woman from using any contraceptive method.” (WHO Family Planning Handbook 2022, p. 357).\n\n2. Available methods include:\n   • Combined hormonal methods (daily pills, monthly injectables, patch, vaginal ring) – WHO lists these among the options to consider (p. 357).  \n   • Progestin-only injectables – they can be started like other methods, and a temporary back-up (for example condoms, spermicides, withdrawal or abstinence) can be used if advised (WHO Handbook 2022, p. 98).  \n   • Barrier or coital-dependent methods such as male/female condoms, spermicides and withdrawal. The Handbook notes that “spermicides and withdrawal are the least effective contraceptive methods” (p. 98).\n\n3. Effectiveness differs. Long-acting or hormonal methods are generally more effective at preventing pregnancy than spermicides or withdrawal (WHO Handbook 2022, p. 98).\n\n4. Choosing a method\n   • Think about how often you want to remember the method (every day, every month, every few months, only at the time you have sex).  \n   • Consider convenience, possible side-effects, and personal preferences.  \n   • Backup protection is sometimes recommended when you first start a method (WHO Handbook 2022, p. 98).\n\nNext steps\nBecause selecting contraception is personal, you may wish to visit a health-care provider or family-planning clinic.

IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication.

There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low. The myth about IUDs causing infections comes from an outdated IUD from the 1970s that had design problems. Today's IUDs are very safe.

Experiences vary; some women feel brief cramping during insertion while others report little pain.\n\nNext steps:\n– Think about your own risk of STIs, tolerance for possible side-effects and personal preferences.  \n– Discuss your questions with a trained health-care provider, who can review your individual situation and help you choose the method that feels right for you.\n\nIf the information above feels insufficient, please talk with a provider to get personalised advice.",

Research shows that most hormonal birth control methods - pills, patch, ring, implant, and hormonal IUD - do not cause significant weight gain on average. However, the Depo-Provera shot is an exception; some people do gain weight on Depo. Everyone's body is different, so individual experiences vary. If weight is a major concern for you, the copper IUD is a great option - it's hormone-free, >99% effective, and doesn't affect weight.

(p. 116)  \n• Weight gain seems less common among Asian women, though individual responses vary. (p. 116)\n\nKey points to consider\n• Everyone’s body responds differently; there is no way to predict exactly how your weight will change.  \n• Normal life changes—diet, activity, aging—also affect weight, so it can be hard to know what is due to the contraceptive and what is not. (p. 47)\n\nIf weight change is a major concern for you, you can:\n• Discuss the full range of contraceptive options with a healthcare provider and choose a method you feel comfortable trying.  \n• Monitor your weight and talk with your provider if you notice changes that bother you; you can always switch methods.  \n• Combine any method you choose with healthy eating and regular physical activity to help manage weight.\n\nIf you would like more personalised advice or want to explore other methods, please visit a qualified healthcare provider or family planning clinic.",

      "ground_truth": "No, using birth control for years will not make it harder to get pregnant when you stop. Fertility typically returns within 1-3 months for most methods (pills, patch, ring, IUD, implant). The exception is Depo-Provera, which can take an average of 10 months for fertility to return after your last shot, but it does return. Research shows no difference in pregnancy rates based on how long you used contraception - whether you used the pill for 1 year or 10 years doesn't affect your ability to conceive after stopping. Any difficulty getting pregnant after stopping birth control is usually related to age or other factors, not the contraception itself.",

On average, pregnancy occurs after 3–6 months of unprotected sex.” (WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 417)\n\n• Progestin-only injectables take a bit longer: women who used DMPA or NET-EN become pregnant, on average, about 10 months after their last injection—roughly 4 months longer than women who used other methods. (p. 116)\n\n• Monthly combined injectables have a shorter delay—about 5 months on average, only 1 month longer than other methods. (p. 140)\n\nThese are averages; some women conceive sooner, and some later. Age and the fertility of both partners also matter.\n\nSo, even after many years of contraceptive use, most people can become pregnant once they stop. If you hope to conceive and don’t become pregnant after a year of regular unprotected sex (or after 6 months if you are 35 years or older), consider seeing a health-care provider for an evaluation.\n\nIf you would like personalised advice or have concerns, a visit to a health-care provider or family-planning clinic is recommended.",
