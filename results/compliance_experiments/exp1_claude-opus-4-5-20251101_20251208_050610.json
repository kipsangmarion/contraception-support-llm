Consistent condom use remains important for preventing transmission, especially if your viral load isn't undetectable.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nSchedule a consultation with your healthcare provider who knows your HIV treatment history. They can assess your individual situation and ensure safe insertion.\n\nIs there anything specific about the copper IUD you'd like to know more about?",

There's a small increased risk of pelvic infection in the first 20 days after insertion, but after that, the risk returns to baseline\n- Modern IUDs are very safe—serious complications are rare\n- The copper IUD may increase menstrual bleeding/cramping; hormonal IUDs often reduce it\n\n**What the evidence shows:**\nIUDs are among the most effective contraceptives available (99%+) and are recommended by major medical organizations, including for people who haven't had children.\n\n**My suggestion:**\nYour friend's experience is valid, but individual experiences vary significantly.

Follow their specific guidance.\n\n- **Tampons and menstrual cups:** If you're on your period, you can use these while swimming with an IUD (though some providers suggest waiting a cycle or two after insertion before using cups)\n\n- **Hot tubs:** Also fine with an IUD\n\nYou can enjoy pools, oceans, lakes, baths, and hot tubs without worrying about your IUD.
