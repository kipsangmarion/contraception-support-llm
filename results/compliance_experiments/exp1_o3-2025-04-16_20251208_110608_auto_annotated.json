      "ground_truth": "It's important to know which type of birth control pill you're considering. Combined oral contraceptives (pills containing both estrogen and progestin) are not recommended in the first 6 weeks after giving birth while breastfeeding, as they may reduce your milk supply. However, progestin-only pills (also called mini-pills) are safe to use while breastfeeding and won't affect your milk. Other good options include the copper IUD, contraceptive implant, or barrier methods like condoms. I'd recommend discussing with your healthcare provider which option works best for you.",
      "model_response": "Congratulations on your new baby!  \nHere are the key points about starting birth-control pills while you are breastfeeding a 3-week-old:\n\n1. Types of pills\n   • Progestin-only pill (POP, “mini-pill”) – contains no estrogen.  \n   • Combined oral contraceptive (COC) – contains both estrogen and progestin.\n\n2. What the guidelines say for breastfeeding women\n   • Progestin-only pill  \n     ‑ World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility Criteria: Category 2 for breastfeeding mothers <6 weeks postpartum (benefits generally outweigh any theoretical risks).  \n     ‑ Therefore you may start a POP any time now if you wish.  \n\n   • Combined pill (estrogen-containing)  \n     ‑ <6 weeks postpartum while breastfeeding: Category 4 (unacceptable risk)—main concerns are reduced milk supply and higher risk of blood clots.  \n     ‑ You should wait until at least 6 weeks postpartum, and many clinicians advise waiting until 6 months or once breastfeeding is well established and you are no longer exclusively breastfeeding.\n\n3. Effect on breast-milk supply\n   • POPs have not been shown to decrease milk volume in most studies.  \n   • Estrogen in combined pills can lower milk supply, especially this early.\n\n4. How to start a progestin-only pill\n   • You can start any day. Take one pill at the same time every day with no pill-free week.  \n   • Use a backup method (condoms) for the first 48 hours after the first pill.  \n   • If you are exclusively breastfeeding, you already have some protection from the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), but adding the POP increases effectiveness.\n\n5. Other postpartum options you could consider\n   • Implants (e.g., Nexplanon), the 3-month injection (Depo-Provera), or a hormonal or copper IUD can all be used immediately or soon after delivery and do not affect milk supply.  \n   • Barrier methods (condoms, diaphragm) or continued LAM if you meet all three criteria (exclusive/near-exclusive breastfeeding, baby <6 months, no return of menses).\n\n6. Next steps\n   • Contact your obstetrician, midwife, or primary-care clinician to get a prescription and review which progestin-only formulation is available to you.  \n   • Schedule your routine postpartum visit (usually around 6 weeks) to reassess your contraceptive needs and overall health.\n\nBottom line: At 3 weeks postpartum, choose a progestin-only pill (or another progestin-only method) if you want to start hormonal contraception now. Wait until at least 6 weeks (preferably later) before considering an estrogen-containing combined pill.",

Please discuss this with your healthcare provider to find a safe method that addresses both your contraceptive needs and menstrual symptoms.",
      "model_response": "I’m not a medical professional, but I can share general, evidence-based information that you can discuss with your doctor.\n\n1. Migraine with aura and estrogen-containing birth-control pills  \n• Combination oral contraceptives (COCs) contain both estrogen and progestin.  \n• Multiple professional guidelines (e.g., U.S. CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria, World Health Organization MEC, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) classify “migraine with aura” as a category in which the risks of estrogen-containing methods usually outweigh the benefits.  \n• The main concern is an elevated risk of ischemic stroke. Estrogen can slightly increase the tendency of blood to clot, and migraine with aura is itself an independent stroke risk factor. When combined, the risk rises further.\n\n2. Safer hormonal options often considered  \nThese methods do not contain estrogen and have not been linked to the same stroke risk in people with migraine with aura:  \n• Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill”)  \n• Hormonal IUD (levonorgestrel IUD)  \n• Copper IUD (non-hormonal)  \n• Etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon)  \n• Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (Depo-Provera)  \nAll have pros and cons regarding bleeding patterns, cramp control, and convenience. Your clinician can match them to your health profile and preferences.\n\n3. Managing cramps (dysmenorrhea) without combined pills  \n• NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) around menses  \n• Heat therapy, exercise, and lifestyle changes  \n• Progestin-only or non-hormonal IUDs often reduce cramps substantially  \n• Evaluation for conditions like endometriosis if pain is severe or worsening\n\n4. Questions to raise at your next visit  \n• “Given my migraine with aura, which contraceptive options are category 1 or 2 for safety?”  \n• “How effective is a progestin-only method at reducing menstrual cramps compared with a combined pill?”  \n• “Could an IUD or implant help both contraception and cramps in my case?”  \n• “Should I see a neurologist or headache specialist before starting any hormonal method?”\n\nKey takeaway  \nPeople with migraine with aura are generally advised to avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives because of stroke risk. Progestin-only methods or non-hormonal options are usually considered safer and can still improve menstrual cramps. Discuss the full range of options and your individual risk factors with your healthcare provider before making a decision.",

Make an appointment with a health-care provider to:  \n   – Verify and work on controlling your blood pressure (target <140/90, and preferably <130/80 if other risk factors).  \n   – Review the full list of your cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, migraines with aura, diabetes, obesity, etc.).  \n   – Choose a contraceptive method that fits your medical profile and lifestyle.\n\n2. Until you have a safe long-term method in place, use condoms every time you have sex to prevent pregnancy.\n\n3. Keep monitoring your blood pressure regularly. Effective BP control could broaden your contraceptive choices and, more importantly, lower your overall health risk.\n\nBottom line\nWith a blood pressure of 160/100 mm Hg, estrogen-containing birth-control pills are not a safe option. Talk with your clinician about progestin-only or non-hormonal methods and, at the same time, focus on bringing your blood pressure under control.",

The copper IUD is particularly recommended as it's highly effective and won't interfere with your cancer treatment. Please coordinate with your oncology team when choosing and placing a contraceptive method.",
      "model_response": "I’m glad you asked—choosing safe and reliable contraception is especially important while you’re being treated for breast cancer. Below is general, evidence-based information to help you prepare for a conversation with your oncology or gynecology team. It is not a substitute for personalized medical advice.\n\n1. Why most hormonal methods are usually avoided  \n• Breast cancers are often hormone-sensitive.  \n• Both combined estrogen-progestin methods (pill, patch, ring) and progestin-only methods (minipill, implant, injectable, hormonal IUD) are classified as “Category 4—unacceptable health risk” by the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for someone with current breast cancer.  \n• Even low-dose or “local” hormonal methods (e.g., levonorgestrel IUD) are generally avoided during active disease or for at least five years after treatment ends, unless your oncology team explicitly OKs them.\n\n2. Non-hormonal options that are considered safe\n\nHighly effective, long-acting\n• Copper IUD (Paragard in the U.S.).  \n  – >99 % effective.  \n  – No hormones; therefore no known stimulation of breast-cancer cells.  \n  – Can stay in place 10+ years but can be removed at any time.  \n  – Your care team will check that blood counts (especially platelets) and uterine anatomy are suitable before insertion, particularly if you’re receiving chemotherapy that could raise infection or bleeding risk.\n\nPermanent\n• Tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy (female sterilization).  \n• Partner vasectomy.  \n  – Both are >99 % effective and hormone-free.  \n  – Irreversible (or difficult to reverse), so reserved for people certain they don’t want future pregnancies.\n\nUser-dependent/Barrier\n• Male or female condoms  \n• Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide  \n• Spermicidal films/gels  \n• Dual protection (e.g., condom + diaphragm) increases effectiveness and also reduces STI risk.  \n  – Typical-use effectiveness is lower than with an IUD or sterilization, so consider using two barrier methods together if pregnancy prevention is critical.\n\nFertility-awareness-based methods\n• Calendar, basal-body-temperature, or cervical-mucus tracking.  \n  – No hormones, but require daily diligence and are less reliable if your cycles become irregular from chemotherapy or endocrine therapy.\n\n3. Practical considerations during treatment\n• Blood counts: Chemotherapy can lower white cells/platelets, increasing infection or bleeding risk during IUD insertion. Your clinician may time insertion between chemo cycles or wait until counts recover.  \n• Pelvic exams: If your treatment causes mucosal thinning or vaginal dryness, lubrication and gentle technique can make IUD placement or barrier-method fitting more comfortable.  \n• Drug interactions: Non-hormonal methods have no known interactions with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or targeted therapies.  \n• Bone health: Some people receive ovarian suppression injections; copper IUD does not exacerbate bone density issues.  \n• Future fertility: If you hope for pregnancy after cancer therapy, a copper IUD is fully reversible.\n\n4. Emergency contraception\n• Copper IUD inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sex is the most effective non-hormonal emergency method.  \n• Hormone-based emergency pills (levonorgestrel, ulipristal) are generally avoided because they are progestin-containing; if needed, discuss risks and benefits with your oncologist.\n\n5. Preparing for your appointment\n• Bring your full cancer treatment plan (medications, surgery schedule, radiation dates).  \n• Note any bleeding disorders, pelvic infections, or anatomical issues.  \n• Clarify your reproductive goals (definitely no more children vs. maybe later).  \n• Ask about timing: “When would you recommend inserting a copper IUD relative to my chemo cycles?”  \n• Discuss the need for dual STI protection if applicable.\n\nKey take-away  \nFor someone undergoing active breast-cancer treatment, non-hormonal methods—especially the copper IUD or barrier methods—are usually preferred. Final selection should be made in consultation with both your oncologist and a contraception specialist to tailor the choice to your health status and future fertility wishes.\n\nThis information is for educational purposes only. Always confirm details and next steps with your treating physicians, who know your individual medical situation best.",

Combined-hormonal methods (anything that contains estrogen, such as the “regular” birth-control pill, the patch, or the vaginal ring)  \n   • Current medical guidelines (U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria, WHO MEC) classify these as Category 4 for anyone with a history of stroke—“unacceptable health risk—method not to be used.”  \n   • Reason: Estrogen increases the tendency for blood clots and can raise blood pressure, both of which raise the chance of another stroke.\n\n2. Progestin-only methods (no estrogen)  \n   • Progestin-only pills (“mini-pill”), the hormonal IUD (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla), the implant (Nexplanon), and the progestin shot (Depo-Provera) are Category 2 in most guidelines for a past stroke—“advantages generally outweigh theoretical or proven risks.”  \n   • They do not carry the same clotting risk as estrogen, but providers still weigh other factors (blood-pressure control, additional vascular risk factors, mobility, current medications such as anticoagulants or antiplatelets).\n\n3. Non-hormonal option  \n   • The copper IUD is Category 1—no restriction—and is considered the safest highly effective method for someone with a history of stroke.\n\n4. Emergency contraception  \n   • Copper IUD is the most effective and has no hormonal risk.  \n   • The levonorgestrel EC pill (Plan B, Take Action, etc.) is progestin-only and acceptable.  \n   • Ulipristal (ella) is also non-estrogenic and acceptable, but you should discuss interactions if you take medications such as anticoagulants.\n\nWhat to do next\n• Schedule a visit with a clinician who can review your stroke history, current medications (for example, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, apixaban), blood-pressure control, and any other risk factors (smoking, migraines with aura, diabetes).  \n• Bring up all available methods so the two of you can balance effectiveness, bleeding profile, convenience, and safety.  \n• If pregnancy must be avoided for medical reasons, consider the failure rates: copper or hormonal IUDs and the implant are the most effective, followed by the shot, then progestin-only pills (which require very consistent daily timing).\n\nKey takeaway\nBecause you’ve had a stroke, contraceptives that contain estrogen (standard combination birth-control pills, patch, ring) are not considered safe. Progestin-only or non-hormonal options are generally acceptable, but make the decision together with your healthcare provider.\n\n(This information is for general education and is not a substitute for personalized medical advice.)",

      "scenario": "I'm 16 years old and considering the Depo-Provera shot. Is that a good choice?",
      "ground_truth": "Depo-Provera can be used at your age and is very effective (>99%), but there's something important to discuss: it can affect bone density while you're still building bone strength during adolescence. This is usually not a major concern for short-term use (under 2 years), and bone density typically returns to normal after stopping. Other methods like the implant or IUD are also very effective and don't have this concern. You might also consider pills or the ring. Would you like to discuss the pros and cons of these options to see which best fits your needs?",
      "model_response": "Only you, together with a qualified clinician, can decide whether Depo-Provera (the “depo shot”) is the best method for you—but knowing the facts ahead of time will help you have a productive conversation. Below is an overview tailored to someone your age.\n\n1. What Depo-Provera is  \n• A prescription injection containing the hormone medroxyprogesterone (a progestin).  \n• Given every 12–13 weeks in a doctor’s office, school-based health center, Planned Parenthood, or other clinic.  \n• Failure rate with perfect use: <1 % per year; with typical use: about 4 % per year—still very effective compared with many other methods.\n\n2. Potential advantages  \n• “Set-it-and-forget-it” for three months—no daily pill to remember.  \n• Can be used by people who can’t take estrogen (e.g., migraine with aura, certain clotting risks, breastfeeding).  \n• Often makes periods lighter; about half of users stop bleeding completely after a year.  \n• Private—no packaging or device partners can see.  \n• May decrease menstrual cramps and lower risk of endometrial cancer.\n\n3. Possible downsides/side effects  \n• Irregular bleeding or spotting is common, especially the first 6–12 months.  \n• Some users gain weight (average 5–8 lb in the first year; a smaller group gains more).  \n• Reversible delay in return to fertility—on average 9–10 months after the last shot, but can be up to 18 months.  \n• Temporary reduction in bone mineral density. This matters more in teens because you’re still building peak bone mass. Experts say it usually recovers after stopping, but you should:  \n  – Get enough calcium (1,300 mg/day for ages 9–18) and vitamin D (600 IU/day).  \n  – Do weight-bearing exercise.  \n  – Avoid smoking/vaping, excessive soda, or extreme dieting.  \n• Requires an appointment every 3 months; if you’re late, you can lose protection.  \n• Doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)—condoms are still important.\n\n4. Special considerations for someone who’s 16  \nConfidentiality: In many places you can consent to contraception without a parent/guardian and the clinic must keep your visit private. Laws differ by state/country, so ask your provider or a trusted adult if you’re unsure.  \nFollow-up: Some clinics schedule a quick weight and blood-pressure check each shot. If you miss it, you could become pregnant.  \nBone health: Because your bones are still growing, most guidelines say teens can use Depo, but it’s wise to reassess every 2 years and be extra diligent about calcium, vitamin D, and exercise.\n\n5. Alternatives you might compare  \n• Implant (Nexplanon): 3 years of protection, very low dose of progestin, no bone impact.  \n• Hormonal IUD (3–8 years depending on type) or copper IUD (10–12 years, hormone-free).  \n• Combination pill, patch, or ring: contain estrogen + progestin, control periods, but require weekly or daily action.  \n• Progestin-only pill: daily pill without estrogen.  \nYour health history (migraines, blood pressure, anemia, acne, etc.) and preferences (period control, frequency of clinic visits, comfort with insertion procedures) will sway which method feels best.\n\n6. How to move forward  \n1. Make an appointment with a clinician (family doctor, gynecologist, adolescent medicine specialist, or a clinic such as Planned Parenthood).  \n2. Be honest about:  \n   – Period patterns, headaches, medical conditions, medications.  \n   – Sexual activity and STI risk (they will not judge; accuracy helps you get the right care).  \n3. Ask about:  \n   – Expected bleeding changes and what to do if spotting bothers you.  \n   – What happens if you’re late for a shot.  \n   – Bone health monitoring and supplements.  \n   – How to get same-day emergency contraception if ever needed.  \n4. Plan for dual protection: keep condoms on hand to protect against STIs and add pregnancy backup if you’re overdue for an injection.\n\n7. Red-flag reasons to seek care promptly after starting  \n• Heavy bleeding soaking through a pad or tampon every hour for several hours.  \n• Severe abdominal pain, severe headaches, vision changes.  \n• Signs of pregnancy (rare but possible if a shot was late).  \n• Severe depression or mood changes.\n\nBottom line  \nDepo-Provera is popular among teens who want a low-maintenance, highly effective method and either cannot or prefer not to use estrogen-containing options. Its biggest trade-offs are irregular bleeding, potential weight change, bone density concerns, and the need for on-time repeat injections. Review your health history and priorities with a clinician to decide whether Depo or another long-acting reversible contraceptive—or even a pill or patch—matches your life best.\n\nGood luck! You’re already making a smart move by researching your options.",

Better options for you include the copper IUD or hormonal IUD (hormone-free or low-dose local hormone), progestin-only pills, or the contraceptive implant.

Safer alternatives are available.\n\nWhy combined pills are a problem  \n• Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain estrogen (usually ethinyl estradiol).  \n• Estrogen raises clotting factors and can increase blood-pressure, stroke, heart-attack, and deep-vein-thrombosis risk.  \n• Diabetes with vascular disease already raises those same risks, so the two together are considered an unacceptable combination (World/UK Medical Eligibility Criteria category 3/4).\n\nWhat methods may still be suitable  \n1. Non-hormonal  \n   • Copper IUD – category 1 (no restrictions).  \n   • Condoms, diaphragm, spermicide – safe but less effective than long-acting options.  \n   • Partner/female sterilisation – permanent option.\n\n2. Progestin-only (no estrogen)  \n   • Progestin-only pill (POP, “mini-pill”) – category 2 (advantages usually outweigh risks).  \n   • Etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon/Implanon) – category 2.  \n   • Levonorgestrel IUS (Mirena/Kyleena/etc.) – category 3 if vascular complications are significant, but many specialists still consider it acceptable because systemic hormone levels are low; decision is individual.  \n   • Depot medroxyprogesterone injection (Depo-Provera) – category 3 (use with caution) because it may worsen lipids and slightly raise clot risk.\n\n3. Permanent or non-pharmacologic choices  \n   • Tubal occlusion, vasectomy of partner.  \n   • Fertility awareness / natural family planning (lowest medical risk but higher failure rate).\n\nWhat to discuss with your clinician  \n• Specific vascular problems you have (retinal vs. kidney vs. peripheral vessels).  \n• Blood-pressure and lipid control.  \n• How well you can remember a daily pill vs. preference for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).  \n• Future pregnancy plans—how soon, if at all.  \n• Potential interactions with any other medications you take (e.g., some antiepileptics, rifampicin).\n\nBottom line  \nBecause of your vascular complications, combined estrogen-containing pills are contraindicated. Ask your health-care provider about a copper IUD, progestin-only pill, implant, or (if appropriate) an LNG-IUS; these methods avoid estrogen and are usually considered safer in your situation.\n\nThis information is for general guidance only and is not a substitute for personal medical advice.

The IUD placement should be done by a trained provider, and it's good to ensure your HIV treatment is stable. This is considered a very safe and effective option for you.",
      "model_response": "Yes. Most women who are living with HIV and are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) can safely use a copper-bearing intra-uterine device (Cu-IUD).\n\n1. What the evidence and guidelines say\n• The World Health Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria (WHO-MEC) classifies Cu-IUD use in women who are HIV-positive, clinically well and/or on ART as Category 2 (benefits generally outweigh any theoretical or proven risks).  \n• If a woman has advanced or symptomatic HIV disease (AIDS) and is not yet clinically stable on treatment, the Cu-IUD is Category 3 (usually avoid until her condition has improved). Once she is clinically well on ART the category reverts to 2.\n\n2. Why it is considered safe\n• The Cu-IUD is non-hormonal, so there are no drug–drug interactions with any antiretroviral medicines.  \n• Large studies have not shown higher rates of pelvic infection or faster progression of HIV in women who use IUDs compared with those who do not.\n\n3. Points to discuss with your healthcare provider before insertion\n• Screening for current pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is recommended. An untreated cervical or uterine infection at the time of insertion—regardless of HIV status—raises the risk of PID shortly after placement.  \n• Your recent CD4 count/viral load and overall immune status. If you are clinically stable on ART, insertion is usually straightforward.  \n• Planned follow-up: return promptly if you develop fever, unusual pelvic pain, foul-smelling discharge, very heavy bleeding or if you suspect expulsion.\n\n4. Ongoing considerations\n• Bleeding and cramping: Cu-IUDs can cause heavier, longer periods or more cramping, especially in the first few months. This does not affect HIV or ART but can be bothersome.  \n• Dual protection: The IUD prevents pregnancy but not HIV transmission or other STIs. Continue condom use to protect partners and to reduce the risk of other STIs, which can in turn increase genital HIV shedding.  \n• Duration and effectiveness: Most copper IUDs protect for 10–12 years; fertility returns immediately after removal.\n\n5. When the Cu-IUD may not be the best choice\n• Current PID, untreated cervicitis, or high suspicion of chlamydia/gonorrhoea.  \n• Unexplained uterine bleeding, anaemia made worse by heavier periods, or uterine abnormalities that distort the cavity.  \n• Advanced untreated HIV disease (severely immunocompromised) until stabilized on ART.\n\n6. Alternatives\n• A levonorgestrel (hormonal) IUD, implants, injectables, pills or condoms alone are also options; most are Category 1 or 2 for women on ART, though some hormonal methods interact with certain antiretrovirals and may require dose considerations.\n\nBottom line\nIf you are clinically stable on ART and have no untreated pelvic infection, you can safely choose a copper IUD. Discuss your medical history and any current symptoms with a trained provider, have appropriate STI screening, and continue condom use for added protection.",

Examples:\n\nProgestin-only methods (no added risk from smoking)  \n• Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill”)—must be taken at the same time every day.  \n• Hormonal IUD (levonorgestrel)—3–8 years of contraception, very low systemic hormone levels.  \n• Implant (etonogestrel rod)—up to 3 years.  \n• Depo-Provera injection—every 3 months (may affect bone density with long-term use).  \n\nNon-hormonal  \n• Copper IUD—up to 10+ years, highly effective.  \n• Barrier methods—condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap.  \n• Permanent—tubal ligation or partner vasectomy.\n\nWhat to do next  \n1. Book a visit with your healthcare provider or a family-planning clinic. Bring up:  \n   • Your smoking history and any other health conditions (migraines, hypertension, clotting disorders, etc.).  \n   • Interest in progestin-only or non-hormonal options.  \n2.

      "ground_truth": "No, the birth control patch (and all methods containing estrogen - pills, ring, injection) are not safe for you because of your history of blood clots. Having had a DVT significantly increases your risk of developing another clot, and estrogen-containing contraceptives would increase that risk even more. Safe and effective alternatives include progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, the hormonal IUD (which has only local hormones), or the copper IUD. All of these are highly effective and won't increase your blood clot risk.",
      "model_response": "Because the patch is a combined hormonal contraceptive (it contains both estrogen and progestin), it is not recommended for anyone who has ever had a deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism—whether the clot occurred 5 years ago or last week.  \n• Estrogen increases the tendency for blood to clot.  \n• The transdermal patch exposes you to a slightly higher average estrogen dose than most birth-control pills, so the clotting risk is at least as high, and possibly higher.  \n• The U.S. CDC/WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria list “history of venous thromboembolism” as Category 4 for the patch (an unacceptable health risk; do not use).\n\nWhat can you use instead?  \nSafe options for someone with a past DVT include:\n\nNon-hormonal  \n• Copper IUD (10+ years of contraception, highly effective, zero hormones)  \n• Barrier methods (condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge)  \n• Permanent contraception (tubal ligation, vasectomy in partner)\n\nProgestin-only hormonal methods (no estrogen)  \n• Levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla) – Category 2 (benefits generally outweigh risks)  \n• Etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon) – Category 2  \n• Depot medroxyprogesterone injection (Depo-Provera) – Category 2  \n• Progestin-only pills (“mini-pill”) – Category 2  \n\nThese methods have not been shown to increase the risk of recurrent clots in most people who are no longer on anticoagulation therapy.\n\nNext steps  \n1. Make an appointment with your clinician and tell them you have a history of DVT.  \n2. Review the non-estrogen options above and your personal preferences (bleeding profile, duration, reversibility, comfort with procedures).  \n3. If you have any lingering symptoms from the previous clot or other medical conditions, bring that information as well—they may influence which progestin-only option is best.\n\nBottom line: Skip the patch and any other estrogen-containing birth control. Choose a non-hormonal or progestin-only method after discussing it with your healthcare provider.",

How contraceptive methods are grouped\n────────────────────────\nLONG-ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION (LARC)  \n• Copper IUD (10–12 yrs; hormone-free)  \n• Levonorgestrel IUDs (3–8 yrs, depending on brand)  \n• Etonogestrel subdermal implant (3–5 yrs)\n\nSHORT-ACTING HORMONAL METHODS  \n• Combined estrogen-progestin options  \n  – Oral “combined pill” (COC)  \n  – Transdermal patch  \n  – Vaginal ring  \n• Progestin-only options  \n  – Progestin-only pill (POP, “mini-pill”)  \n  – Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DMPA, 3 mos)\n\nBARRIER & SPERMICIDAL METHODS  \n• External & internal condoms (also reduce STI risk)  \n• Diaphragm / cervical cap + spermicide  \n• Spermicidal films, gels, foams\n\nPERMANENT METHODS  \n• Female sterilization (salpingectomy or tubal occlusion)  \n• Vasectomy (male sterilization)\n\nEMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION  \n• Oral levonorgestrel (up to 72 h, modest efficacy to 120 h)  \n• Oral ulipristal acetate (up to 120 h)  \n• Copper IUD (most effective EC; can be inserted ≤5 d after unprotected sex)\n\n────────────────────────\n2. Efficacy at a glance (first-year pregnancy rates)\n────────────────────────\nHighly effective (<1 %): IUDs, implant, sterilization  \nModerately effective (4–7 %): pills, patch, ring, DMPA  \nLess effective (13–21 %): condoms, diaphragm, fertility awareness  \nLeast effective (20 %+): spermicides used alone, withdrawal\n\n────────────────────────\n3. The MEC “traffic-light” system clinicians check\n────────────────────────\nCATEGORY 1 (green) No restriction  \nCATEGORY 2 (light green) Benefits generally outweigh risks  \nCATEGORY 3 (yellow) Risks usually outweigh benefits—use only if safer methods unavailable or unacceptable  \nCATEGORY 4 (red) Unacceptable health risk—method contraindicated\n\nSelected examples (not exhaustive):\n• ≤48 h postpartum, breastfeeding Estrogen-containing methods = 4 (contraindicated)  \n• ≥6 w postpartum, breastfeeding COC becomes 2; progestin-only 1  \n• Migraine with aura Estrogen methods = 4  \n• Blood pressure ≥160/100 mmHg Estrogen methods = 4; progestin-only pill 3; IUDs 1–2  \n• Current breast cancer All hormonal methods = 4; copper IUD = 1  \n• Age ≥35 and smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day Estrogen methods = 4  \n• HIV infection (on ART, viral suppressed) Most methods 1–2; check drug interactions with certain progestins\n\n────────────────────────\n4. Key counselling points\n────────────────────────\nEffectiveness: LARC > short-acting hormonal > barrier/FABM.  \nSafety: Screen for contraindications (migraine aura, hypertension, clotting disorders, liver disease, breast cancer).  \nSide-effects: Unschedule bleeding (most methods), weight change (injection), acne (implant), heavier menses (copper IUD).  \nSTI prevention: Only condoms provide substantial protection.  \nReturn to fertility: Immediate once IUD/implant removed or pills/patch/ring stopped; average 9 mos after last DMPA shot.  \nNon-contraceptive benefits: Lighter periods & reduced dysmenorrhea (LNG-IUD, COC), acne improvement (some COCs), decreased endometrial/ovarian cancer risk (COC).  \nEmergency options: Sooner is better; copper IUD works regardless of BMI or cycle day.  \nAdherence: Missed pills, late injections, ring/patch delays raise pregnancy risk; set reminders or choose LARC if adherence is hard.\n\n────────────────────────\n5. Practical next steps for anyone choosing a method\n────────────────────────\n1. List current health conditions, medications, and smoking status.  \n2. Consider non-contraceptive goals (cycle control, acne, dysmenorrhea, STI prevention).  \n3. Discuss all options with a clinician using the MEC chart to rule in/out each method.  \n4. Have blood pressure measured before starting estrogen-containing methods.  \n5. Schedule follow-up if problems arise (e.g., prolonged bleeding on DMPA or IUD).\n\n────────────────────────\n6. When to seek immediate medical care (“ACHES” for estrogen users)\n────────────────────────\nA Abdominal pain severe  \nC Chest pain or shortness of breath  \nH Headache severe / migraine with aura  \nE Eye problems (vision loss, blurring)  \nS Severe leg pain or swelling  \nThese could signal a blood clot, liver issue, or stroke—stop estrogen and consult emergency services.\n\n────────────────────────\nBottom line\n────────────────────────\nMany safe, highly effective contraceptive choices exist. The “best” method depends on medical eligibility, lifestyle, and personal preferences. Review your full history with a health-care professional, who can apply the MEC categories, check for drug interactions, and perform any necessary exams or tests before prescribing or inserting a method.\n\nDisclaimer: This information is educational and not a substitute for individualized medical advice.

      "model_response": "Condoms are a very good—but not fool-proof—method of birth-control.\n\nHow effectiveness is measured  \nResearchers look at how many people become pregnant over the course of one year while using a method:\n\n• Typical (real-world) use: includes all the mistakes people actually make—putting the condom on late, taking it off early, tearing it with teeth, using oil-based lube, etc.\n\n• Perfect use: the condom is used correctly every single time sex occurs.\n\nNumbers for external (“male”) condoms  \n• Typical-use effectiveness ≈ 87 % (about 13 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year).  \n• Perfect-use effectiveness ≈ 98 % (about 2 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year).\n\nNumbers for internal (“female”) condoms  \n• Typical-use effectiveness ≈ 79 % (about 21 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year).  \n• Perfect-use effectiveness ≈ 95 % (about 5 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year).\n\nWhat affects condom effectiveness  \n• Putting it on before any genital-genital contact begins.  \n• Checking the expiration date and package for air leaks or damage.  \n• Using a new condom every time.  \n• Leaving space at the tip and pinching out air bubbles.  \n• Using adequate lubricant; stick to water- or silicone-based lubes with latex condoms (oil breaks latex).  \n• Storing them away from heat, sunlight, and friction (wallets and car glove boxes can shorten shelf life).  \n• Holding the rim during withdrawal so it doesn’t slip off.\n\nAdditional benefits  \nCondoms are the only widely available method that also reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.\n\nCombining methods  \nIf you want even higher protection, consider using condoms together with another contraceptive (e.g., birth-control pills, IUD, implant, emergency contraception after an accident).\n\nKey takeaway  \nUsed perfectly every time, condoms prevent about 98 % of pregnancies and most STIs; real-world effectiveness is lower mainly because of human error. Learning correct use and combining methods can close that gap.\n\nThis information is general health education, not personal medical advice.

      "model_response": "The contraceptive implant (Nexplanon/Implanon NXT) is one of the most reliable forms of reversible birth control currently available.\n\nEffectiveness  \n• Typical-use failure rate: ≈0.1% per year (about 1 pregnancy per 1,000 users in the first year).  \n• Because there’s nothing to remember daily or weekly, “typical use” is essentially the same as “perfect use,” so real-world protection is consistently >99%.\n\nWhy it’s so effective  \n• A small plastic rod (4 cm × 2 mm) placed under the skin of your upper arm continuously releases the hormone etonogestrel.  \n• It mainly prevents ovulation and also thickens cervical mucus, making it hard for sperm to reach an egg.\n\nDuration of action  \n• Licensed for 3 years, though emerging data suggest it remains highly effective for at least 4 and possibly up to 5 years. Many clinicians still recommend replacement at 3 years until longer-term guidance is universally adopted.\n\nWhen protection starts  \n• Inserted during the first 5 days of your menstrual cycle: protection is immediate.  \n• Inserted at any other time: use a backup (e.g., condoms) for 7 days.\n\nFactors that can lower effectiveness  \n• Certain liver-enzyme–inducing medications (some anti-seizure drugs, rifampin, some HIV meds, St John’s wort) can speed up hormone breakdown—discuss alternatives with your prescriber.  \n• Body weight/BMI has not been shown to meaningfully reduce efficacy within the approved 3-year interval.\n\nBenefits  \n• No daily action required; discreet and reversible.  \n• Rapid return to fertility once removed (often within days to weeks).  \n• May lighten or stop periods over time (about 1 in 3 users become amenorrheic).  \n• Safe for most people who can’t use estrogen (e.g., migraines with aura, smokers >35 yrs, postpartum).\n\nPossible downsides/side effects  \n• Irregular bleeding or spotting (most common reason for removal).  \n• Headache, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, or weight change in a subset of users.  \n• Insertion/removal requires a short office procedure (local anesthetic; small scar possible).  \n• Does not protect against sexually transmitted infections—use condoms if STI protection is needed.\n\nBottom line  \nIf placed correctly by a trained clinician and you’re not on interacting medications, the implant offers >99% protection against pregnancy for up to 3 years with virtually no effort on your part. For personalized advice and to confirm it’s a good fit for your health profile, schedule a consultation with a healthcare provider familiar with long-acting reversible contraception.",

      "model_response": "Emergency contraception (EC) is very good at preventing pregnancy, but how well it works depends on 1) the method you choose and 2) how soon after the unprotected sex you use it.  \nBelow are the three main options used in the United States, listed from most- to least-effective.\n\n1. Copper IUD (ParaGard)  \n• Pregnancy rate: ≈ 0.1 % (about 1 in 1,000) when inserted for EC  \n• Time window: Up to 5 days after the episode of unprotected sex, or up to 5 days after the estimated day of ovulation—whichever is later.  \n• Bonus: Provides highly effective ongoing birth-control for 10+ years.  \n• Downsides: Requires an office visit for insertion; higher up-front cost if uninsured.\n\n2. Ulipristal acetate 30 mg tablet (ella) – prescription only  \n• Pregnancy rate in studies: 1–2 % overall (≈ 85–90 % reduction in expected pregnancies).  \n• Time window: Up to 120 hours (5 days); effectiveness is fairly constant across the whole window.  \n• Works better than levonorgestrel pills on days 4–5 and in people with higher body weight, though efficacy may drop if BMI ≥ 35.  \n• Need to wait at least 5 days before starting or restarting hormonal birth-control (it can make those methods less effective during that time).\n\n3. Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg tablet (Plan B One-Step and generics) – over-the-counter  \n• Pregnancy rate in real-world use: 1–2 % if taken within 24 h; rises to 2–3 % by 72 h; overall risk-reduction ≈ 75–89 %.  \n• Time window: Best within 72 h; can be used up to 120 h but effectiveness falls sharply after the third day.  \n• Weight effect: Evidence suggests reduced efficacy if body weight > 165 lb (75 kg) or BMI > 25; it still helps, but ella or a copper IUD is preferred.  \n• You can restart regular hormonal birth-control immediately after taking it.\n\n(Levonorgestrel IUDs such as Mirena and Liletta are also highly effective emergency contraception when placed within 5 days; failure ≈ 0.3 %, but most clinics still use the copper IUD because of longer data history.)\n\nKey points for all methods  \n• Sooner is always better—take or schedule EC as quickly as you can.  \n• None of these options ends an existing pregnancy; they work mainly by delaying or preventing ovulation.  \n• They do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.  \n• If you vomit within 2 hours of taking an EC pill, repeat the dose.  \n• If your period is more than 1 week late or is very light, take a pregnancy test.  \n• Consider starting (or resuming) a reliable ongoing contraceptive method so you won’t need emergency contraception next time.\n\nWhen to seek medical advice immediately  \n• Severe abdominal pain 3–5 weeks after taking EC (could indicate ectopic pregnancy).  \n• Signs of allergic reaction or any symptom that worries you.\n\nThis information is accurate as of 2024 but is not a substitute for personalized medical advice. If you have questions about which option is right for you—especially if you’re breastfeeding, take certain medications, or have a higher body weight—speak with a clinician or a pharmacist as soon as possible.",

This means fewer than 1 out of 100 women using a copper IUD will get pregnant each year. It's hormone-free, lasts for 10-12 years (depending on the brand), and fertility returns immediately after removal. It's also the most effective form of emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.",
      "model_response": "Yes.  The copper IUD (ParaGard in the U.S.; various brand names elsewhere) is one of the most effective reversible methods of contraception available.\n\nHow effective is it?\n• Typical-use failure rate: ≈ 0.6–0.8 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year (well over 99 % effective).  \n• Because there is no user action after insertion, “perfect use” and “typical use” effectiveness are essentially the same.  \n• It also works as the most effective form of emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse, with a failure rate of < 0.1 %.\n\nHow does it work?\n• The plastic T-shaped frame is wrapped with copper wire.  \n• Copper ions released into the uterine cavity create an environment that is toxic to sperm and interferes with fertilization; it may also inhibit implantation.  \n• No hormones are involved.\n\nDuration of protection\n• Approved for up to 10 years in many countries (some guidelines say up to 12 years if inserted at age 25 or older).  \n• Fertility returns quickly once the device is removed.\n\nAdvantages\n• Very high effectiveness and “forgettable” once placed.  \n• Hormone-free—useful if you cannot or prefer not to use estrogen or progestin.  \n• Can be used while breastfeeding.  \n• Cost-effective over time.  \n• Rapid return to fertility after removal.  \n• Serves as highly reliable emergency contraception when needed.\n\nPossible downsides / side effects\n• Heavier or longer periods and stronger cramps in the first few months (often improve after 3–6 cycles).  \n• Spotting between periods, especially early on.  \n• Insertion can be uncomfortable; taking an NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen) beforehand can help.  \n• Small risks: device expulsion (about 2–10 % over the first year), perforation of the uterus during insertion (~1 in 1,000 insertions), pelvic infection mainly within the first 20 days if an undiagnosed STI is present.  \n• Does NOT protect against sexually transmitted infections—add condoms if STI protection is needed.\n\nWho shouldn’t use it?\n• Current pelvic inflammatory disease or certain untreated STIs.  \n• Known uterine or cervical cancer, unexplained abnormal bleeding.  \n• Significant uterine cavity distortion (e.g., large fibroids).  \n• Copper allergy, Wilson’s disease (impaired copper metabolism).  \n• Discuss other specific medical conditions with a clinician.\n\nInsertion and follow-up\n• Usually placed in a clinic in a procedure lasting a few minutes; can be done any time pregnancy is reasonably ruled out.  \n• Mild cramping and spotting are common for a day or two.  \n• A follow-up visit or self-check of the strings is advised to be sure the IUD remains in place.\n\nBottom line\nWith a failure rate well under 1 %, the copper IUD is among the most reliable contraceptive options and can provide 10+ years of hormone-free protection, though users should be prepared for heavier periods or cramping at least initially. Talk with a qualified healthcare professional to confirm it’s suitable for you and to arrange insertion or removal.\n\n(This information is general and not a substitute for personal medical advice.)",

      "ground_truth": "The vaginal ring is about 91% effective with typical use, similar to birth control pills. With perfect use it's more than 99% effective. The ring releases hormones continuously for 3 weeks, then you remove it for a week. The difference between perfect and typical use exists because people sometimes forget to replace the ring on time or it may fall out. If you want similar effectiveness without having to remember monthly changes, you might consider the implant or IUD which are >99% effective.",
      "model_response": "The birth-control ring most commonly prescribed in the United States is NuvaRing (there are now a few generics, but they all work the same way). It is a small, soft, flexible ring that you insert into the vagina and leave in place for three weeks, then remove for a one-week ring-free break. While it is in place it steadily releases two hormones, ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen) and etonogestrel (a progestin), which prevent ovulation and thicken cervical mucus.\n\nEffectiveness \n\n• Perfect use (using exactly as directed, every cycle, without any gaps): about 99% effective—fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 ring users in the first year.\n\n• Typical use (accounts for real-world mistakes, late insertions, forgetting to replace the ring after the ring-free week, etc.): about 91% effective—roughly 9 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year.\n\nIn other words, with average use about 1 in 10 users will have an unintended pregnancy in a year; with flawless use, pregnancy is very rare.\n\nWhat influences effectiveness\n\n1. Timing errors  \n   • Leaving the ring out for more than a total of 3 hours during the three-week wear period.  \n   • Forgetting to insert a new ring at the end of the ring-free week or after four full weeks of continuous use (if using the extended schedule).\n\n2. Certain medications or supplements  \n   • Rifampin-class antibiotics, some anti-seizure drugs, certain HIV meds, and St. John’s wort can lower hormone levels and reduce effectiveness.\n\n3. Vomiting or severe diarrhea do NOT affect the ring (unlike the pill), but expulsion (ring slipping out without being noticed) can.\n\nUsing the ring correctly\n\n1. Insert one ring and leave it in place for 21 days (three weeks).  \n2. Remove it for 7 days; during this time you usually get a withdrawal bleed.  \n3. Insert a new ring on the same day of the week every cycle, even if you’re still bleeding.\n\nAlternate schedules  \n• Extended use: Wear each ring for four weeks (28 days) and replace immediately with the next one, skipping ring-free weeks and therefore skipping periods.  \n• 24/4 schedule: Wear 24 days, remove for 4.\n\nIf the ring is out for ≤3 hours: rinse with cool/lukewarm water and re-insert; no backup needed.  \nIf out >3 hours (or you’re not sure how long): re-insert as soon as possible and use condoms or avoid sex for the next 7 days. If this happened during the first week of a new cycle or if you had unprotected sex in the previous 5 days, you may need emergency contraception.\n\nAdvantages\n\n• Convenient—one action per month rather than daily pill.  \n• Rapid return to fertility once stopped.  \n• Predictable, often lighter and less painful periods; can be used to skip periods.  \n• Lower estrogen dose than many combined pills.\n\nDisadvantages / possible side effects\n\n• Requires comfort with vaginal insertion/removal.  \n• Potential hormonal side effects: breast tenderness, nausea, mood changes, spotting, rare blood-clot risk (similar to combined pills).  \n• No protection against sexually transmitted infections—use condoms if STI risk exists.\n\nWhen to avoid or be cautious\n\n• History of blood clots, certain migraines, uncontrolled high blood pressure, smoking >15 cigarettes/day age ≥35, certain liver diseases, some cancers. Discuss with a health-care professional.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith perfect, consistent use the ring is over 99 % effective; with typical real-world use, about 91 %. If ease of use appeals to you and you have no medical contraindications, it’s a highly reliable form of contraception—just remember to insert and replace it on schedule and use backup if it’s out for more than three hours. Always check with your clinician or pharmacist about possible drug interactions and whether the ring is a safe option for you.",

      "model_response": "Short answer  \nBoth types are extremely effective—well over 99 %—and the difference between them is so small that, in practice, they are considered equally reliable methods of contraception.\n\nWhat the numbers look like  \n(The figures below are pregnancies per 100 users in the first year, “typical use.” Because an IUD requires no daily action, “perfect use” rates are essentially the same.)\n\n• Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (Mirena, Liletta, Kyleena, Skyla): ≈ 0.1–0.3 pregnancies/100 women-years (≈ 99.7–99.9 % effective).  \n• Copper IUD (ParaGard): ≈ 0.6–0.8 pregnancies/100 women-years (≈ 99.2–99.4 % effective).\n\nWhy the hormonal IUD may show slightly lower failure rates  \nThe levonorgestrel released by the device thickens cervical mucus and suppresses the endometrium, adding a second mechanism (in addition to the foreign-body effect that both IUD types share). Statistically, that translates into a few fewer pregnancies per thousand users, but for any individual person both devices rank among the most effective reversible methods available.\n\nPick based on other factors  \nSince effectiveness is essentially a tie, most people choose between them based on:\n\nHormonal IUD  \n• Often makes periods much lighter or stops them altogether  \n• Can reduce menstrual cramps and endometriosis-related pain  \n• May cause hormonal side-effects (e.g., breast tenderness, mood changes, acne) in a minority of users  \n• Approved for 3–8 years of use depending on brand and local guidelines\n\nCopper IUD  \n• No hormones—good for those who prefer or must avoid hormonal exposure  \n• Periods may become heavier or crampier, especially in the first 3–6 months  \n• Approved for up to 10–12 years of use (some guidelines allow longer off-label)\n\nBottom line  \nIf near-perfect pregnancy prevention is your primary goal, both the hormonal and copper IUDs deliver. Let other considerations—bleeding pattern, side-effect profile, hormone preference, cost, and how long you want contraception—to guide the final choice. Always discuss individual medical factors with a qualified clinician.",

      "model_response": "Depo-Provera (the contraceptive injection that contains the hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate) is one of the most effective reversible birth-control options available.\n\nEffectiveness\n• Perfect use (every shot on time, no delays): about 99.8 % effective. Fewer than 1 woman out of 100 will get pregnant in the first year.\n\n• Typical use (accounts for the fact that some shots are given late or missed): about 94 % effective. Roughly 6 women out of 100 may become pregnant in the first year when shots are not received exactly on schedule.\n\nKey points that affect effectiveness\n1. Timing matters: Each injection protects you for 12–13 weeks, but you need a repeat shot every 12 weeks (or at most every 15 weeks) to maintain peak protection.\n2. Starting the method:\n   • If you get your first shot within the first 5–7 days of your menstrual period, you’re protected immediately.\n   • If you start at any other time, use a backup method (e.g., condoms) for 7 days.\n3. Certain medicines (some seizure medications, rifampin, St. John’s wort, etc.) may slightly reduce hormonal contraceptive effectiveness; discuss these with your provider.\n4. You can use Depo-Provera right after childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion in most cases.\n\nOther considerations\n• No STI protection: Combine with condoms if you need protection from sexually transmitted infections.\n• Bleeding changes: Irregular bleeding and eventual lighter or absent periods are common.\n• Delayed return to fertility: After your last injection, it can take 9–10 months (occasionally longer) for ovulation and periods to come back, even if you only had one shot.\n• Bone density: Long-term use can slightly reduce bone mineral density; calcium/vitamin D intake, weight-bearing exercise, and periodic reassessment with your provider are advised.\n• Side-effects: Possible weight changes, mood changes, headaches, breast tenderness, among others. Severe side-effects are uncommon but report anything worrisome to a clinician promptly.\n\nBottom line\nWhen injections are received on time, Depo-Provera is about as effective as sterilization for the time you’re using it. The biggest reason for unplanned pregnancies on this method is late or missed injections, so setting reminders and keeping regular appointments is crucial.\n\nThis information is general and should not replace personalized medical advice.

Around 1 in 5 couples (≈22 pregnancies per 100 women in a year) will experience an unintended pregnancy.  \n• Perfect use: about 96 % effective. Roughly 4 pregnancies per 100 women in a year when withdrawal is done correctly every single time.\n\nWhy the difference?  \n• Pre-ejaculatory (pre-cum) fluid can contain sperm.  \n• It’s easy to mistime withdrawal or allow semen to contact the vulva.  \n• Alcohol/drugs, distraction, or inconsistent motivation can reduce control.  \n• Requires the partner with the penis to know their point-of-no-return and to pull out every single time.\n\nOther points to keep in mind  \n• Withdrawal offers NO protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  \n• Combining it with a barrier (e.g., condom) or another method (e.g., fertility awareness, emergency contraception if a slip occurs) greatly improves protection.  \n• Plan B/levonorgestrel EC can be used up to 3 days after an accident, Ella (ulipristal) up to 5 days, and a copper IUD is the most effective EC up to 5 days.  \n• If pregnancy prevention is a top priority, consistently using condoms, a hormonal method (pill, patch, ring, shot, implant), or an IUD is far more effective.  \n• Discuss with a health-care provider which method fits your circumstances, health, and preferences.\n\nWithdrawal can reduce risk somewhat and costs nothing, but it’s one of the least reliable stand-alone methods. Using it as your sole contraception means accepting a considerably higher chance of pregnancy compared with most other options.",

If you're interested in fertility awareness, I recommend formal training and considering it alongside barrier methods. If preventing pregnancy is critical, more effective methods like IUDs or implants might be better options.",
      "model_response": "Fertility-awareness methods (FAMs)—sometimes called “cycle tracking,” “the rhythm method,” or Natural Family Planning—work by identifying the days each cycle when you could become pregnant and then either avoiding intercourse or using a barrier method (such as condoms) on those days.\n\n1. How effective are they?\n   • Perfect (correct and consistent) use: about 95-99% effective, meaning 1–5 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year.  \n   • Typical, real-world use: about 77-88% effective, meaning 12–23 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year.\n\n   The wide range is because there are several ways to track fertility and because effectiveness drops quickly if any step is missed or if a backup method isn’t used during the fertile window.\n\n2. Factors that affect effectiveness\n   • The specific method used:  \n     – Symptothermal (combining temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) is generally the most accurate.  \n     – Standard Days or calendar-only methods are less precise, especially for people with cycle lengths outside 26-32 days.  \n   • Consistency: You must check and record signs daily and either abstain or use a barrier method for about 7–10 days per cycle.  \n   • Cycle regularity: FAMs work best for people whose cycles vary by only a few days month to month.  \n   • Training: Learning from a certified instructor or a reputable program significantly improves success rates.  \n   • Life factors: Illness, stress, travel, breastfeeding, perimenopause, and certain medications can change your fertile signs and make tracking harder.\n\n3. Pros\n   • Non-hormonal, no drug-related side effects.  \n   • Can increase body awareness and partner communication.  \n   • Inexpensive after any initial classes or supplies.\n\n4. Cons\n   • Requires daily commitment and partner cooperation.  \n   • Less forgiving of mistakes than many other methods.  \n   • No protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  \n   • Effectiveness drops if cycles are irregular or if you occasionally skip charting.\n\n5. Tips to maximize effectiveness\n   • Get formal instruction (in person or virtual) for the specific method you choose.  \n   • Combine more than one fertility sign (symptothermal) rather than relying on a calendar alone.  \n   • Keep meticulous daily records—apps can help but should not replace understanding your signs.  \n   • Plan ahead for backup protection or abstinence during the fertile window.  \n   • Re-evaluate after life changes (e.g., postpartum, approaching menopause) when cycles may become less predictable.\n\nBottom line: Fertility-awareness methods can be a good fit for some couples willing to track carefully and avoid unprotected sex during the fertile days, but they generally prevent pregnancy less reliably than IUDs, implants, injectables, pills, rings, or condoms. If you need higher protection or want STI coverage, consider using FAMs with condoms or another barrier method. If you’d like personalized guidance, a health-care provider or certified FAM educator can help you decide whether these methods match your goals and lifestyle.",

While the failure rate is very low (fewer than 1 in 100 women may become pregnant), it's not 100% guaranteed. Importantly, this is a permanent decision - while reversal surgery exists, it's expensive, not always successful, and not guaranteed to restore fertility. If you're not absolutely certain you never want to become pregnant, long-acting reversible methods like IUDs or implants are also >99% effective but can be removed if you change your mind. Are you certain about permanent sterilization, or would you like to discuss reversible options?",
      "model_response": "Tubal ligation (“having your tubes tied”) is one of the most effective forms of permanent birth control, but no method is 100 % fool-proof. Here are the key points:\n\n1. How it works  \n   – The fallopian tubes are cut, sealed, clipped, banded, or cauterized so sperm and egg cannot meet.  \n   – It is intended to be permanent; reversal surgery is possible for some women but is expensive, not guaranteed, and should be considered experimental.\n\n2. Effectiveness  \n   – About 99 % effective in typical use.  \n   – In the first year after the procedure, roughly 1–5 women out of 1,000 (0.1–0.5 %) may become pregnant, depending on the technique used and the surgeon’s experience.  \n   – Cumulative failure rises slightly over time; long-term studies show about 1–2 % of women may experience pregnancy within 10 years.\n\n3. Why pregnancies can still occur  \n   – Spontaneous re-connection of the tubes (tubal “recanalization”) or an incomplete closure.  \n   – A mistaken belief you can’t get pregnant before the procedure has fully taken effect (rare, because ligation works immediately unless done during pregnancy).  \n   – Tubal ligation done very soon after delivery (post-partum) has a slightly higher failure rate.  \n   – Younger age is linked to a higher lifetime chance of failure simply because of more years of sexual activity afterward.\n\n4. Ectopic pregnancy risk  \n   – If pregnancy occurs, the odds it will be ectopic (in the tube) are much higher than for women without a ligation.  \n   – Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency—seek care promptly if you have abdominal pain, shoulder pain, dizziness, or unusual bleeding with a positive pregnancy test.\n\n5. Protection against STIs  \n   – Tubal ligation does NOT protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections; condoms are still advised if STI protection is needed.\n\n6. Confirmation and follow-up  \n   – Most surgeons do not routinely “check” the tubes after a standard ligation, but you should have a follow-up visit to review healing.  \n   – If you ever miss a period or have pregnancy symptoms, take a pregnancy test and see your provider right away because of the ectopic risk.\n\n7. Alternatives  \n   – Long-acting reversible contraception (IUDs or implants) are nearly as effective, last years, and can be removed if you change your mind.  \n   – Vasectomy for a male partner is slightly more effective and less invasive.\n\nBottom line: Tubal ligation is extremely reliable, yet about 1–2 % of women will become pregnant at some point afterward, and any such pregnancy carries a higher chance of being ectopic. If you want permanent contraception and understand the small residual risk, it remains an excellent option, but be sure to discuss all questions with your healthcare provider before deciding.",

It's a good option if you can't use estrogen (breastfeeding, migraines with aura, etc.). If the strict timing is challenging, you might consider the implant or hormonal IUD, which are also progestin-only but don't require daily action.",
      "model_response": "Effectiveness of the progestin-only pill (POP, “mini pill”) in a nutshell  \n• Perfect (correct, consistent) use: >99 % effective – fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 users in a year.  \n• Typical, real-world use: about 91–93 % effective – roughly 7-9 pregnancies per 100 users in a year.\n\nWhy the gap between perfect and typical use  \nThe POP has a very small “forgiveness window.” Most brands must be taken at the same time every day, with no more than a 3-hour difference. (The newer drospirenone-containing POPs such as Slynd allow a 24-hour window.) A pill that is late or missed by more than this window, vomiting/diarrhea soon after a dose, or certain medications can all lower protection quickly.\n\nHow the mini pill works  \n1. Thickens cervical mucus so sperm can’t enter the uterus (reliable in every cycle).  \n2. Suppresses ovulation in about 40-60 % of cycles (higher with some newer POPs).  \n3. Thins the uterine lining.\n\nWhat can reduce effectiveness  \n• Late or missed pill (beyond the allowed window).  \n• Severe vomiting or diarrhea within ~3 hours of taking it.  \n• Liver-enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., some seizure medicines, rifampin, St. John’s wort).  \n• Starting a new pack late after the 28 inactive/active pills are finished.\n\nTips to maximize protection  \n• Take it at the exact same time every day—set phone alarms or use reminder apps.  \n• Keep a backup pack in your bag or at work.  \n• If a pill is late or missed, use condoms or avoid sex for the next 48 hours and follow the instructions in your pill packet.  \n• Use condoms whenever you’re on interacting medications or have vomiting/diarrhea.  \n• Start the POP right after childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion if no hormonal contraindications; use backup for the first 48 hours if you start at any other time in your cycle.\n\nComparison with other methods (typical-use effectiveness)  \n• Combined estrogen-progestin pill/ring/patch: ~93 %  \n• Depo-Provera shot: ~96 %  \n• Implant or IUD: >99 %  \n• External condom alone: ~87 %\n\nKey advantages of the POP  \n• Safe while breastfeeding and for people who can’t use estrogen (e.g., migraine with aura, clot risk, smokers over 35).  \n• Quick return to fertility once stopped.  \n• May reduce menstrual cramps and bleeding over time.\n\nPossible downsides  \n• Irregular spotting/bleeding is common.  \n• Must be taken on a strict schedule.  \n• Slightly higher chance that a pregnancy, if it occurs, could be ectopic—so any positive pregnancy test with pain or bleeding warrants prompt medical care.\n\nBottom line  \nIf you take the progestin-only pill exactly as directed, it is an extremely effective contraceptive (>99 %). In day-to-day life, about 1 in 10 users will become pregnant each year, mainly because of late or missed pills. Setting up reliable reminders and knowing what to do if you’re late or on interacting medications can keep your protection close to the perfect-use level.\n\nThis information is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for personalized medical advice.

      "ground_truth": "Spermicide used alone is only about 72% effective with typical use, which means about 28 out of 100 women relying solely on spermicide will get pregnant within a year. Even with perfect use, it's only 82% effective. Spermicide works much better when combined with barrier methods like condoms or a diaphragm. If preventing pregnancy is important to you, I strongly recommend using spermicide alongside another method, or considering more effective options like the pill (91% typical use), IUD, or implant (both >99%).",
      "model_response": "Spermicide (most brands use the chemical nonoxynol-9) can reduce the chance of pregnancy, but it is one of the least-effective stand-alone contraceptive options.\n\nHow well it works  \n• Typical (average, real-life) use: about 21 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year → roughly 79 % effective.  \n• Perfect use (used exactly as directed every single time): about 15 pregnancies per 100 users in the first year → roughly 85 % effective.\n\nWhy the difference?  \nSpermicide must be placed deep in the vagina no more than 30–60 minutes before intercourse and remain in place at least 6 hours afterward. Any deviation—intercourse beyond the effective window, not reapplying with every act, vaginal douching, etc.—raises the failure rate.\n\nKey points to know  \n• Best used with another barrier (male or female condom, diaphragm, cervical cap) to raise effectiveness and provide STI protection.  \n• Does NOT protect against sexually transmitted infections; frequent use of nonoxynol-9 can actually irritate tissue and make HIV or STI transmission slightly easier.  \n• Possible side-effects: vaginal or penile irritation, allergic reactions, more frequent urinary-tract or yeast infections in some users.  \n• Available without a prescription in the U.S. as gels, foams, films, suppositories, and sponges.\n\nBottom line  \nIf avoiding pregnancy is critical, rely on spermicide only as a back-up, not a primary method. Pairing it with consistent condom use, a diaphragm, long-acting reversible contraception (IUD, implant), or hormonal methods greatly improves protection. For personalized advice, discuss options with a healthcare professional.",

      "model_response": "Yes—there are still emergency contraception (EC) options you can use 4 days (≈ 96 hours) after unprotected sex.\n\n1. Ulipristal acetate pill (brand name Ella in the U.S.)  \n   • Works up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse.  \n   • Effectiveness is consistent throughout that window and generally higher than levonorgestrel-based pills taken this late.  \n   • Prescription required in the United States; available over the counter in some other countries.  \n   • If you are breastfeeding or take certain medications (e.g., some seizure drugs, St. John’s wort, rifampin), discuss this with a clinician because these can reduce its effectiveness.\n\n2. Copper IUD (e.g., ParaGard)  \n   • Can be inserted up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex, and in some cases even later if it’s within 5 days of estimated ovulation.  \n   • More than 99% effective as EC and then provides long-term contraception for up to 10 years.  \n   • Requires an in-clinic visit for insertion by a trained healthcare professional.\n\n3. Levonorgestrel EC pills (Plan B One-Step, Take Action, My Way, etc.)  \n   • Labeled for use within 72 hours (3 days) but may still offer some protection up to 96 hours; effectiveness decreases with time.  \n   • Available without a prescription in most pharmacies (no age restriction in the U.S.).  \n   • Less effective than ulipristal or a copper IUD at 4 days, especially if you have a higher body weight (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²).\n\nHow to proceed quickly\n• If you can get a prescription or reach a clinic, ulipristal (Ella) is your most effective pill option at this point.  \n• If you can see a healthcare provider who places IUDs within the next day or two and you want ongoing contraception, a copper IUD is the most effective overall.  \n• If neither of the above is available promptly, taking a levonorgestrel EC pill now is better than doing nothing, though its efficacy may be reduced.\n\nAfter taking EC\n• It can temporarily alter your menstrual timing (earlier or later).  \n• If your period is more than a week late or you have pregnancy symptoms, take a pregnancy test.  \n• EC does not protect against future unprotected sex, so consider starting or resuming a regular contraceptive method.  \n• EC does not protect against STIs; if there’s a risk, consider testing.\n\nWhere to get help fast\n• Many pharmacies carry both types of EC pills and may help you locate a clinic for an IUD.  \n• Telehealth services can prescribe ulipristal in some regions with overnight shipping.  \n• Planned Parenthood or similar reproductive-health clinics often provide same-day or next-day EC and IUD services.\n\nIf possible, contact a healthcare provider or pharmacy today to discuss which option you can access quickest.",

(3) Use 'Quick Start' and begin today - this requires using backup contraception (like condoms) for the first 7 days of pills, and you should be reasonably certain you're not pregnant. Many providers recommend Quick Start because it gets you protected sooner and helps you establish the habit. Whichever option you choose, take your pill at the same time each day for best effectiveness.",
      "model_response": "Starting birth-control pills is very flexible—you can usually begin almost any time you like—but the exact “best” day depends on  \n• the type of pill (combined estrogen-progestin vs. progestin-only)  \n• where you are in your menstrual cycle  \n• whether you’ve recently been pregnant or are switching from another method.\n\nBelow are the common start options, how quickly each protects you, and when you need a backup (condoms, abstinence) during the first week.\n\n————————————————\n1. Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills (COCs)\n————————————————\nThese contain both estrogen and progestin and come in 21-, 24-, or 28-day packs.\n\nA. Day-1 (menstrual-period) start  \n• Take the first pill on the first day you see real bleeding (not just spotting).  \n• Protection: Immediate—no backup needed.  \n• Pros: Bleeding makes it easy to remember; lowest chance you were already pregnant.  \n• Cons: If your period starts on a weekday, you’ll finish packs on that same weekday every month, which some people find inconvenient.\n\nB. Sunday start  \n• Take the first pill on the first Sunday after your period begins (or the same day if your bleeding starts on a Sunday).  \n• Protection: Use backup for 7 consecutive days.  \n• Pros: Many 28-day packs are labeled for a Sunday start; bleeding will usually occur weekdays rather than a weekend.  \n• Cons: Slightly higher risk of ovulation escape in the first cycle if you miss pills; requires a week of backup protection.\n\nC. Quick start (today, regardless of cycle day)  \n• Confirm you’re not pregnant (reasonably sure: negative pregnancy test if period is late, no unprotected sex in the past 2-3 weeks, etc.).  \n• Take the first pill today.  \n• Protection: Use backup for 7 consecutive days if you start more than 5 days after your last period began.  \n• Pros: Convenient; reduces chance of forgetting to start later.  \n• Cons: May cause irregular bleeding in the first pack; must rule out early pregnancy.\n\nD. Post-pregnancy\n• After a first-trimester miscarriage or abortion: You can start COCs immediately; protection is immediate, but use 7 days of backup if more than 7 days have passed since the event.  \n• After childbirth: Start at 3 weeks postpartum if you’re not breastfeeding and have no clotting risk; if breastfeeding, wait until 6 weeks postpartum or choose a progestin-only pill.\n\n————————————————\n2. Progestin-Only Pills (POPs, “mini-pills”)\n————————————————\nTake one pill every day at (roughly) the same time; there are no hormone-free days.\n\nWhen to start  \n• Day-1 start (within the first 5 days of your period): Immediate protection.  \n• Any other day: Start today; use backup for 2 days (World Health Organization) or 7 days (US CDC—more conservative).  \n\nPost-pregnancy  \n• Anytime within 4 weeks after childbirth, even while breastfeeding: Immediate protection.  \n• After 4 weeks postpartum: Start any day; use backup for 2 days.\n\n————————————————\nGeneral tips for both types\n————————————————\n1. Be sure you’re not pregnant now: recent negative pregnancy test, normal period within the last 4–5 weeks, no unprotected intercourse since then, or you’ve used reliable contraception consistently.  \n2. Take the first pill from the correct part of the pack (usually the first active tablet).  \n3. Set reminders (phone alarm, app) to take a pill at the same time daily.  \n4. If you need emergency contraception because of recent unprotected sex, you can usually take it and then start or continue pills right away—ask your provider.  \n5. See a clinician promptly if you develop severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling, vision changes, or severe abdominal pain (possible clot or other serious problem).  \n\n————————————————\nShould I wait for my next period?\n————————————————\nMedically, there’s rarely a reason to wait. The quick-start approach is safe, reduces unplanned pregnancy, and is recommended by major professional bodies (ACOG, WHO, CDC). Waiting is only needed if you or your clinician are not reasonably sure you’re not already pregnant.\n\n————————————————\nWhen in doubt\n————————————————\n• Read the pill’s specific patient insert—some brands have unique instructions.  \n• If you have certain medical conditions (high blood pressure, migraines with aura, clotting disorders, smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day at age ≥35, certain medications that interact with birth control), talk to a clinician to be sure combined pills are safe for you; you may be steered toward progestin-only or a non-hormonal method.  \n• If your cycles are irregular and it’s hard to know when your last period began, use a quick start with a pregnancy test and 7 days of backup.\n\n————————————————\nBottom line\n————————————————\n1. Pick a start method: Day-1, Sunday, or quick start (today).  \n2. Use backup exactly as listed above.  \n3. Take one pill every day; don’t skip the hormone-free days unless the pack instructs you to.  \n4. If you miss pills later, follow the “missed pill” directions in your package or ask a pharmacist/clinician.\n\nThat’s it—you’re on birth control! If anything is unclear or you have medical conditions, checking in with a healthcare provider or pharmacist is always wise.",

Throw away any other missed pills.  \n     – Continue the pack as scheduled (again, you might take two pills in one day).  \n     – Use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.  \n     – If you missed pills during the first week of the pack AND had unprotected sex in the previous 5 days, consider emergency contraception.  \n     – If there are fewer than 7 active pills left in the pack, finish the active pills, skip the placebo/ hormone-free days, and start a new pack so you maintain 7 straight “active-pill” days.\n\n2) PROGESTIN-ONLY PILL (POP / “mini-pill”)  \n   There are two timing windows, so check your brand’s leaflet:  \n   – Traditional norethindrone POPs: a pill is “late” > 3 hours after the usual time.  \n   – Desogestrel-containing POPs (e.g., Cerazette, Slynd): “late” > 12 hours.\n\n   If you’re LATE or have MISSED a POP:  \n   – Take one pill as soon as you remember.  \n   – Take the next pill at your regular time (again, you may take two in one day).  \n   – Use condoms or abstain for the next 48 hours.  \n   – If unprotected sex occurred during that 48-hour back-up window (or in the 5 days before that), consider emergency contraception.\n\n3) EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION (EC)  \n   – Most effective within 72 hours but can be used up to 5 days after sex (ulipristal or a copper IUD are effective up to 120 hours).  \n   – If you take ulipristal (Ella), wait 5 days before restarting any hormonal pill; use condoms those 5 days plus another 7 days after you restart the pill.  \n   – Levonorgestrel EC (Plan B, Take Action, etc.) can be taken and you can resume pills immediately, but still use condoms 7 days.\n\n4) WHEN TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP  \n   – You’re not sure which pill type you use.  \n   – You’ve missed multiple pills several times this cycle.  \n   – You think you might be pregnant (missed withdrawal bleed, pregnancy symptoms).  \n   – You have vomiting/ severe diarrhea within 3 hours after taking a POP or 24 hours after a COC (this may count as a “missed” dose).\n\n5) QUICK TIPS TO AVOID FUTURE MISSES  \n   • Keep the pack next to something you use daily (toothbrush, phone charger).  \n   • Set a recurring alarm or use an app reminder.  \n   • Carry a spare blister or keep one at work/school.  \n   • If you frequently miss pills, ask your clinician about longer-acting options (ring, patch, injection, IUD, implant).\n\nRemember: this information is general and does not replace personalized medical advice. If anything here is unclear or doesn’t match your pill’s instructions, consult a healthcare provider or pharmacist.",

Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (brand names: Plan B One-Step, Take Action, My Way, generics)  \n   • Best within 72 hours (3 days).  \n   • Can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days), but effectiveness drops each day.  \n   • Available over-the-counter in the U.S. for all ages—no ID or prescription required.\n\n2. Ulipristal acetate 30 mg (brand name: ella)  \n   • Effective up to 120 hours (5 days) after sex, with little decline in effectiveness over that period.  \n   • Requires a prescription in the U.S. (some online services offer next-day shipping).\n\nDevice  \n\n3. Copper IUD (Paragard)  \n   • The most effective EC available.  \n   • Can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected sex OR up to 5 days after the earliest estimated day of ovulation—sometimes giving a slightly longer window than pills.  \n   • Must be placed by a trained clinician, and then provides more than 10 years of ongoing birth control.\n\nKey points to remember  \n\n• The sooner, the better: take or arrange EC right away, even if you think you’re still “within the window.”  \n• If you vomit within 2–3 hours of taking an EC pill, take another dose.  \n• Levonorgestrel pills may be less effective in people with higher body weight (BMI ≥ 25–30). Ulipristal or a copper IUD is preferred in that situation.  \n• EC won’t end an existing pregnancy and won’t protect you from additional unprotected sex later in the same cycle—you’ll need condoms or another reliable method.  \n• If your period is more than a week late, take a pregnancy test.  \n• Side effects are usually mild: temporary nausea, headache, breast tenderness, or cycle changes.\n\nIf you’re unsure which method is right for you or need help obtaining it quickly, contact a healthcare provider, pharmacist, or a telehealth/online pharmacy service as soon as possible.",

      "ground_truth": "An IUD can be inserted at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you're reasonably certain you're not pregnant. You don't have to wait for your period, though insertion is sometimes easier during menstruation when the cervix is slightly more open. Your provider will likely do a pregnancy test before insertion. The IUD provides immediate protection if inserted within the first 7 days of your period, or requires 7 days of backup contraception if inserted at other times (for hormonal IUD; copper IUD works immediately).",
      "model_response": "Short answer  \nAn IUD (intra-uterine device) can be inserted almost any time you and your clinician are reasonably sure you are not pregnant—including the same day you request it. The most common windows are:  \n• During your period (days 1-7)  \n• Any other day of the cycle if pregnancy is ruled out with history and/or a pregnancy test  \n• Immediately after childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion (with some caveats)  \n• Up to 5 days after unprotected sex for copper-IUD emergency contraception  \n\nWhy timing used to matter (and why it usually doesn’t now)  \nOlder practice favored inserting during menstruation because the cervix is slightly dilated and pregnancy is unlikely. Research shows that, with proper screening, insertion on any day is equally safe and effective. Modern guidelines (e.g., WHO, CDC U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria) say “same-day” insertion is acceptable if pregnancy is reasonably excluded.\n\nHow clinicians rule out pregnancy  \n• Negative pregnancy test (ideally ≥ 3 weeks after last unprotected sex)  \n• No sex since last normal period, or consistent/ correct contraceptive use  \n• Within 7 days after start of normal menses  \n• Within 4 weeks postpartum and fully breastfeeding with no menses, etc.  \nIf there is any doubt, they may have you return or start a short course of another method until insertion.\n\nCycle-related considerations  \n• Copper IUD (Paragard): insert any day; can also be placed ≤ 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse as the most effective “morning-after” option.  \n• Hormonal IUDs (levonorgestrel 52 mg and 19.5 mg): insert any day; if inserted > 7 days after cycle start, you need backup (condoms/abstinence) for 7 days.  \n• Many people prefer insertion during menses because cramps/bleeding are already present and pregnancy anxiety is lower.\n\nPost-pregnancy timing  \n• Immediate postpartum: within 10 minutes of placental delivery—done in the hospital. Expulsion risk is slightly higher but many like the convenience.  \n• Early postpartum: > 10 minutes to 48 hours is also acceptable in many places.  \n• Delayed postpartum: ≥ 4 weeks after delivery is standard in outpatient settings.  \nBreastfeeding is not a contraindication.\n\nAfter miscarriage or abortion  \n• Any time ≤ 12 weeks gestation: same-day insertion is usually offered.  \n• After ≥ 13 weeks: wait until the uterus is back to normal size (generally 2 weeks).\n\nScreening for infections  \nGuidelines recommend chlamydia/gonorrhea screening in people ≤ 25 years or at risk. If your test is pending, you can still have the IUD placed; treatment can begin if the result comes back positive.\n\nWhen you should NOT get an IUD inserted  \n• Confirmed or suspected pregnancy  \n• Current pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or untreated genital infection  \n• Certain cancers (cervical, endometrial) or unexplained uterine bleeding  \n• Uterine abnormalities that distort the cavity (e.g., large fibroids)  \n• Copper allergy or Wilson’s disease (for copper IUD)\n\nWhat to expect at the appointment  \n1. Consent, medical history, and possibly STI screening.  \n2. Pelvic exam to assess uterine size, position.  \n3. Insertion takes ~5 minutes: speculum, cleansing, local anesthetic optional, thin inserter passes through cervix, arms deploy, strings trimmed.  \n4. Cramps for a few minutes to a day; spotting may last a few weeks.  \n5. Follow-up is optional unless you have symptoms (pain, fever, very heavy bleeding, cannot feel strings).\n\nTips for comfort  \n• Take ibuprofen 600-800 mg 30-60 minutes beforehand (if no contraindications).  \n• Eat beforehand, bring a support person, practice relaxation breaths.  \n• Ask about a paracervical block or misoprostol if previous difficult insertion.\n\nBottom line  \nIf you are medically eligible and not pregnant, an IUD can be inserted on nearly any day, including the day you request it, after childbirth, miscarriage, or for emergency contraception. Contact your healthcare provider or a family-planning clinic to discuss timing that fits your situation.",

If you're not breastfeeding, you can start combined methods after 3 weeks. Let's discuss your feeding plans to determine the best timing for you.",
      "model_response": "You do not have to wait for your six-week postpartum checkup to begin contraception. The safest start-time depends on 3 main things:\n\n1. Whether you are breastfeeding.\n2. Your risk of blood clots (all women are at increased risk right after delivery; estrogen-containing methods add to that).\n3. The type of method you want.\n\nBelow is a quick reference followed by details.\n\nQUICK REFERENCE\n• Immediately after birth (within minutes to days): Copper IUD, hormonal IUD, contraceptive implant, Depot-Provera (progestin shot), progestin-only pill (“minipill”), condoms, lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), permanent tubal ligation, vasectomy for partner.  \n• At/after 3 weeks (21 days) if NOT breastfeeding: Any estrogen-containing method (pill, patch, ring) provided you have no other clot-risk factors.  \n• At/after 6 weeks (42 days) if YOU ARE breastfeeding: Estrogen-containing methods (pill, patch, ring) are considered safe because milk supply is established and clot risk has fallen.  \n• After uterus/cervix return to normal size (about 6 weeks): Diaphragm, cervical cap, some fertility-awareness methods.\n\nWHY THE TIMING DIFFERS\n\n1. Blood-clot risk  \n   • The first 3–6 weeks after delivery carry the highest baseline risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Estrogen can roughly triple that risk, so most guidelines (WHO, CDC) advise waiting:\n     – 21 days if you are not breastfeeding and have no other risk factors.  \n     – 42 days if you are breastfeeding or have additional clot risks (obesity, smoking, cesarean birth, etc.).  \n\n2. Breastfeeding and milk supply  \n   • Estrogen can reduce milk volume in some people if started very early. Progestin-only or non-hormonal methods do not have this effect. By 6 weeks postpartum, milk supply is typically well established, so combined estrogen methods become acceptable.\n\n3. Uterine size and cervical dilation  \n   • Diaphragms/cervical caps must fit the cervix snugly, and your uterus returns to pre-pregnancy size by about 6 weeks, making refitting necessary.\n\nMETHOD-BY-METHOD DETAILS\n\nIUDs (Copper T or Hormonal/Levonorgestrel)\n   • Can be inserted within 10 minutes of placental delivery (“post-placental”), within 48 hours, or any time ≥4 weeks after birth.  \n   • If placed immediately, expulsion rates are slightly higher than if placed after 4 weeks, but convenience and effectiveness are still excellent.\n\nContraceptive Implant (etonogestrel rod, e.g., Nexplanon)\n   • Can be inserted right after delivery, before you even leave the hospital. Does not affect breastfeeding.\n\nDepot-Medroxyprogesterone Shot (Depo-Provera)\n   • May be given immediately postpartum. Next dose every 12–14 weeks. Safe with breastfeeding.\n\nProgestin-Only Pill (POP or “minipill”)\n   • Can start any day after delivery. Best started before sexual activity resumes to establish routine. Continue taking daily at the same time.\n\nCombined Estrogen–Progestin Pill, Patch, or Vaginal Ring\n   • Not breastfeeding: start at 3 weeks if no clot risk factors; otherwise wait until 6 weeks.  \n   • Breastfeeding: wait until 6 weeks, then reassess.  \n   • If you choose these, use backup protection until you have taken pills for 7 days (or kept patch/ring in place for 7 days).\n\nBarrier Methods (condoms, spermicide)\n   • Anytime. Condoms also protect against STIs, which can be more easily transmitted postpartum due to cervical changes.\n\nDiaphragm/Cervical Cap\n   • Refitting recommended at ≥6 weeks postpartum because your cervix and vaginal canal change size and shape after pregnancy.\n\nFertility Awareness-Based Methods (FABMs)\n   • Return of ovulation is unpredictable, especially if breastfeeding. Consider waiting until cycles become regular, or use a certified instructor to adjust algorithms for postpartum changes.\n\nLactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)\n   • Up to 98 % effective for the first 6 months IF all three are true:\n     1. Exclusive or near-exclusive breastfeeding (feeds every 4 h daytime, every 6 h nighttime).  \n     2. Mother is <6 months postpartum.  \n     3. No vaginal bleeding/period since 56 days postpartum.  \n   • At the first sign of any change (supplementing, longer stretches at night, menses), add another contraceptive.\n\nPermanent Contraception\n   • Tubal ligation can be done within 24 hours of vaginal birth or at cesarean section, or any time later.  \n   • Vasectomy for partner is possible any time; use backup until semen analysis is clear (usually 8–12 weeks).\n\nEmergency Contraception\n   • Copper IUD: most effective, can double as long-term contraception.  \n   • Oral EC pills (levonorgestrel or ulipristal) are safe any time postpartum. Ulipristal requires pumping-and-discarding milk for 24 hours after the dose.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n• You can leave the hospital with contraception in place—ask before delivery if you’re interested in an IUD, implant, tubal ligation, or shot.\n\n• Progestin-only and non-hormonal methods can start immediately, even while breastfeeding.\n\n• Wait 3–6 weeks for estrogen methods, depending on breastfeeding and clot-risk factors.\n\n• Diaphragm/cap users need refitting after 6 weeks.\n\n• Attend your postpartum visit (usually 4–6 weeks) to review bleeding patterns, blood-pressure check, and confirm the method you chose is working for you.\n\nWhen in doubt, discuss your medical history (birth complications, hypertension, migraines, clotting disorders, etc.) with your healthcare provider to choose the earliest and safest start date.",

      "model_response": "Switching from the pill to an IUD is usually straightforward, but the exact timing depends on\n\n• which kind of IUD you choose (hormonal = levonorgestrel or non-hormonal = copper)  \n• where you are in your pill pack or menstrual cycle  \n• whether you want continuous pregnancy protection during the change-over  \n\nHere are the standard recommendations used by most clinicians (WHO, CDC “MEC” guidelines, Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare, etc.):\n\n1. Keep taking your active pills right up to the day of the IUD insertion appointment.  \n   • This ensures you are very unlikely to be pregnant on the day your IUD goes in.  \n   • It also keeps your cycle predictable and can make insertion easier if it coincides with or just after your period.\n\n2. Day of insertion  \n   • Hormonal IUD (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla)  \n     – If the IUD is placed within the first 7 days of your natural menstrual cycle OR while you are still taking active combined pills, you are protected immediately.  \n     – If it’s placed more than 7 days after the start of your own period AND you have not been on active pills during that interval (e.g., you finished a pack and skipped a week), use a back-up method (condoms or keep taking pills) for 7 days after insertion.  \n   • Copper IUD (Paragard)  \n     – Works instantly no matter when it’s inserted, so you can stop your pills the same day the IUD is placed. No back-up is needed.\n\n3. After insertion  \n   • Hormonal IUD: if back-up is required (see above), either keep taking your pill for 7 more days after the insertion or use condoms during that time; then you can stop the pill entirely.  \n   • Copper IUD: you may stop the pill immediately after insertion if you wish.\n\n4. Ideal calendar options (if you can choose)  \n   • During the last week of active pills or the placebo week—especially if that coincides with menstrual bleeding.  \n   • Any time you have been taking your pills correctly and consistently and have not had sex without protection in the previous 5 days.\n\n5. Practical steps before the appointment  \n   • Schedule a consultation for counseling, medical history review, and screening for STIs if indicated.  \n   • Take an NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen) 30–60 min before the appointment if you do not have contraindications; it can ease insertion cramping.  \n   • Ask about insurance authorization and cost coverage ahead of time.\n\n6. When NOT to insert an IUD (requires evaluation first)  \n   • Known or suspected pregnancy  \n   • Current pelvic inflammatory disease or untreated cervical infection (chlamydia/gonorrhea)  \n   • Certain uterine anomalies, very large fibroids, or copper allergy (for copper IUD)  \n   • For hormonal IUDs: current breast cancer or very severe liver disease\n\n7. Early warning signs after insertion (seek care promptly)  \n   • Severe pelvic pain, fever, foul discharge  \n   • Heavy bleeding soaking >1 pad/hour for several hours  \n   • Strings suddenly seem much longer or shorter (possible expulsion)\n\nKey takeaway  \n• The simplest plan is: keep taking your pill up to the insertion visit. Copper IUD → you’re covered right away and can quit the pill that day. Hormonal IUD → keep the pill or use condoms for 7 days after insertion unless the IUD was placed during active pills or within 7 days of your period’s start.\n\nAlways confirm timing and individual medical considerations with your own healthcare provider; this guidance is based on typical protocols for people who use combined or progestin-only oral contraceptives and have no complicating health conditions.",

Ulipristal acetate EC (ella)  \n• Wait 5 full days after taking ella before you start a hormonal method. Starting sooner can lower ella’s effectiveness.  \n• On Day 6, begin your chosen method and keep using backup (condoms or abstain) for 7 more days (9 days for the patch or ring; 2 days for progestin-only pills).  \n• If you have unprotected sex during the 5-day waiting period you might need another dose of ella or a copper IUD.\n\n3. Copper IUD used as EC  \n• The copper IUD itself provides highly effective ongoing contraception for up to 10+ years; no additional method is needed.  \n• If you’d rather switch to something else later, ask your clinician; you can have the IUD removed and start another method at any time you’re protected by the IUD.\n\nGeneral tips  \n• If you vomit within 3 hours of swallowing an EC pill, take another dose as soon as possible.  \n• Check a home pregnancy test if your next period is more than a week late or if you have pregnancy symptoms; repeat about 3 weeks after EC if no bleeding occurs.  \n• Schedule a clinic visit if you need help choosing a routine method, want an IUD or implant, or have any concerning symptoms (severe abdominal pain, very heavy bleeding, persistent vomiting, etc.).\n\nThis guidance is based on CDC and World Health Organization recommendations, but always follow any instructions your own clinician gives you and don’t hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional if anything is unclear.",

Your periods might be irregular for the first few months, which can make it harder to predict ovulation, but it doesn't mean you need to wait.

      "model_response": "For most people, fertility returns very quickly once they stop taking oral contraceptives—often within the first month.\n\nKey points\n\n1. How fast ovulation can resume  \n   • Combined oral contraceptive pill (COC): Ovulation may occur as soon as 8–14 days after the last active pill. That means you could, in theory, conceive during your first “pill-free” cycle.  \n   • Progestin-only “mini-pill”: Fertility can return even more rapidly—sometimes within a few days—because its effect on ovulation is shorter-lived.\n\n2. When to expect a period  \n   • Many people get a withdrawal bleed a few days after stopping the pack and then a true menstrual period 4–6 weeks later.  \n   • It’s also normal for cycles to be irregular for a month or two while your body readjusts.\n\n3. Average time to pregnancy  \n   • About 50–60 % of people who stop the pill and are actively trying will conceive within the first three months.  \n   • By one year, pregnancy rates are similar to those of people who were never on hormonal contraception.\n\n4. Factors that can influence timing  \n   • Age (fertility gradually declines after 35).  \n   • Pre-existing cycle or ovulation problems that the pill may have been masking (e.g., PCOS, thyroid disorders).  \n   • General health, body weight, stress, and partner’s fertility.\n\n5. When to seek medical advice  \n   • If you have no period after three months off the pill (and pregnancy has been ruled out).  \n   • If you have been trying to conceive for 12 months (6 months if you’re 35 or older) without success.\n\nTips if you’re planning a pregnancy  \n   • Start a prenatal vitamin with at least 400 mcg of folic acid while still on the pill or as soon as you stop.  \n   • Schedule a pre-conception visit to review vaccines, medications, and any health conditions.  \n   • Track ovulation signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or ovulation predictor kits) if you want to pinpoint your most fertile days.\n\nBottom line  \nYou can become pregnant almost immediately after stopping the pill, though it’s also perfectly normal for it to take a few cycles for your periods and fertility to feel “back to normal.” If anything seems off or you’ve been trying for a while without success, check in with your healthcare provider for individualized guidance.",

If you have a progesterone-only ring, are postpartum, or have another medical condition, talk with a clinician right away.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. Reinsert the ring right away\n-------------------------------------------------\n• Rinse it with cool/warm (not hot) water and put it back in as soon as you can.  \n• Do not boil or disinfect it with chemicals.  \n• If the ring is lost or damaged, insert a new one from your prescription pack as soon as possible.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n2. Use back-up contraception for the next 7 days\n-------------------------------------------------\nBecause it was out for more than the allowed time (3 hours for most combined rings; 2 hours cumulative in 24 h for Annovera), sperm could potentially reach an egg if you ovulate.  \n• Use condoms or abstain from intercourse for the next 7 consecutive days.  \n• Keep the ring in the whole time—even during sex or tampon use—unless it accidentally comes out again (then rinse and reinsert immediately).\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n3. Decide whether emergency contraception (EC) is needed\n-------------------------------------------------\nThink about when you last had unprotected vaginal sex:  \n• If the ring came out during Week 1 of your cycle (Days 1-7 of ring use) AND you had intercourse in the previous 5 days, pregnancy risk is highest. Consider taking EC (e.g., a levonorgestrel pill within 72 h, or ulipristal acetate or a copper IUD within 5 days).  \n• If you’re in Week 2 (Days 8-14) or early Week 3, EC is usually not required if you follow the 7-day back-up rule, but you may still use it for extra reassurance.  \n• EC is not harmful if taken unnecessarily. When in doubt, it’s reasonable to use it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n4. What to do for the rest of this cycle (NuvaRing / EluRyng)\n-------------------------------------------------\n• If you’re in Week 1 or Week 2: leave the ring in until you complete 21 days of ring-in time, then do your usual 7-day ring-free break.  \n• If you’re in Week 3: you have two options.  \n  A. Insert a NEW ring immediately and start a fresh 21-day cycle (skip the ring-free week this month). OR  \n  B. Remove the ring now, have your 7-day ring-free break immediately, then insert a new ring.  \n  Either option requires 7 days of back-up contraception after the ring was out.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n5. If you’re using ANNOVERA\n-------------------------------------------------\n• Any time the ring is out for >2 cumulative hours in a 24-hour period, rinse and reinsert as soon as possible and use back-up contraception for 7 days.  \n• Keep using the same ring for up to 13 cycles (1 year) unless it’s lost or damaged.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n6. Call your pharmacist or healthcare provider if:\n-------------------------------------------------\n• You can’t find or replace the ring.  \n• You’re unsure which week you’re in.  \n• You have contraindications to estrogen or progestins.  \n• You experience severe abdominal pain, chest pain, severe headaches, vision changes, or swelling/leg pain (possible warning signs of clotting—rare but serious).\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nQuick reference summary\n-------------------------------------------------\n1. Rinse and put the ring back in now.  \n2. Use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.  \n3. Consider emergency contraception if it came out in Week 1 and you had sex in the last 5 days.  \n4. Follow the week-specific guidance above for the rest of this cycle.  \n5. When in doubt—or if you have trouble remembering where you are in the cycle—contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nThis information is based on the U.S. prescribing information for NuvaRing, EluRyng, and Annovera, and the CDC’s Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (2021).

      "ground_truth": "I'd be happy to help you find a method that works for you. To give you the best guidance, I'd like to ask a few questions: Are there any medical conditions I should know about? Do you have preferences about hormonal vs non-hormonal methods? How important is effectiveness vs. having lighter or no periods? Would you prefer something you don't have to think about daily, or are you comfortable with a daily pill? Also, how soon might you want to become pregnant in the future? Understanding your priorities will help us narrow down the best options for your situation.",
      "model_response": "I’m happy to give you an overview of birth-control options and the factors that usually go into choosing among them. This is general educational information, not a substitute for a personalized discussion with a clinician who can review your health history in detail.\n\n1. First, think about your priorities  \n   • Effectiveness (typical-use pregnancy rates)  \n   • How long you’d like protection (days, months, years, permanent)  \n   • Hormonal vs. non-hormonal  \n   • How often you’re willing to think about it (daily pill vs. once-placed device)  \n   • Non-contraceptive benefits (lighter periods, acne control, reduced cramps)  \n   • Side-effects or medical conditions you want to avoid (e.g., migraines with aura, clotting disorders, heavy periods)  \n   • STI protection—external (male) and internal (female) condoms are the only methods that reduce risk of sexually transmitted infections.\n\n2. Highly effective, low-maintenance (“LARC” methods)  \n   a. Hormonal IUD (3–8 years depending on brand)  \n      • Releases a small amount of progestin locally  \n      • >99% effective; periods often get lighter or stop  \n      • Side-effects: irregular bleeding first few months, rare expulsion, rare perforation  \n      • Good if you want very light or no periods; not ideal if you dislike procedures involving your cervix.  \n   b. Copper IUD (up to 10–12 years)  \n      • Non-hormonal; >99% effective  \n      • Periods may be heavier/crampier at first  \n      • Can be used as emergency contraception if placed within 5 days after unprotected sex.  \n   c. Implant (etonogestrel rod in upper arm, 3 years)  \n      • >99% effective; insertion/removal through a tiny skin incision  \n      • Irregular bleeding is common; some experience acne, mood changes.\n\n3. Short-acting hormonal methods  \n   a. Combined pill (estrogen + progestin, taken daily)  \n      • 91% effective with typical use (about 1 in 10 users become pregnant in a year); >99% with perfect use  \n      • Regulates periods, can treat acne & cramps  \n      • Requires remembering daily; not recommended if you smoke ≥15 cigarettes/day or have migraines with aura, clotting disorders, certain hypertension or other contraindications.  \n   b. Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill” or newer 24-hour drospirenone pills)  \n      • Safer for people who can’t take estrogen (e.g., breastfeeding, clot risk)  \n      • Must be taken at roughly the same time each day; irregular bleeding possible.  \n   c. Patch (change weekly)  \n      • Similar hormones & benefits/risks to combined pills; 91% effective typical use  \n      • Visible on skin; slightly higher estrogen exposure—avoid if >198 lb for some brands.  \n   d. Vaginal ring  \n      – Monthly ring (3 weeks in, 1 week out) or yearly ring (replaced every month)  \n      • Similar effectiveness and estrogen risks to pills/patch, but lower daily dose; comfortable for most.  \n   e. Injection (depot-medroxyprogesterone, every 12–13 weeks)  \n      • 94% effective typical use; convenient for some, but must return every 3 months  \n      • Can cause irregular bleeding, weight gain, reversible bone-density loss; delay in return to fertility (average 9–10 months after last shot).\n\n4. Barrier methods & on-demand options  \n   • External (male) condoms – 82% effective typical use; STI protection; inexpensive/free; use every act  \n   • Internal (female) condoms – 79% effective; STI protection; may feel less tight for partner  \n   • Diaphragm or cervical cap – 80–88% effective with spermicide; reusable; need fitting for some brands  \n   • Spermicides or vaginal pH gels – 72–86% effective alone; can irritate tissue  \n   • Withdrawal – 78% effective typical use; no cost, but requires good partner control  \n   • Fertility awareness methods – ~77–98% depending on diligence; daily monitoring of cycles/temp; no side effects but requires abstinence or barrier during fertile window.\n\n5. Permanent options (for when you’re sure you’re done with fertility)  \n   • Tubal ligation / removal (female sterilization) – >99% effective; laparoscopy or postpartum; permanent  \n   • Vasectomy (for partner) – >99% effective after confirmation test; simpler, cheaper, lower risk than tubal surgery; use backup until sperm-free.\n\n6. Emergency contraception (EC) – backup, not primary method  \n   • Levonorgestrel pill (“Plan B,” generics) – within 72 h, modestly less effective after; OTC  \n   • Ulipristal acetate (“ella”) – up to 120 h, more effective esp. on days 3–5 and if BMI >25; Rx in U.S.  \n   • Copper IUD – most effective EC; up to 5 days (some data up to 10 days) after unprotected sex; then provides long-term contraception.\n\n7. Common non-contraceptive considerations  \n   • Heavy, painful periods → hormonal IUD, combined pill, ring, patch, or depot shot can help  \n   • Acne → certain combined pills approved for acne; some progestins may worsen it  \n   • Migraines with aura, clotting disorders, strong family history of VTE → avoid estrogen; consider progestin-only or non-hormonal  \n   • Endometriosis → continuous combined pills, hormonal IUD, or depot shot often used  \n   • Breastfeeding → progestin-only pill, shot, implant, IUDs safe; avoid estrogen until ~6 weeks postpartum\n\n8. A quick effectiveness snapshot (typical use)  \n   >99% → IUDs, implant, sterilization  \n   94–97% → injection  \n   91% → pill, patch, ring  \n   79–88% → condoms, diaphragm, fertility awareness, withdrawal  \n   Note: Perfect use raises all of these, but “typical” reflects real-world mistakes.\n\n9. Practical next steps  \n   • Make a short list of what matters most to you (e.g., “I want the most effective method that’s low maintenance and hormone-free” → copper IUD; “I want lighter periods and fewer cramps” → hormonal IUD or combined pill).  \n   • Check any health conditions or medications that could interact (certain seizure meds, HIV meds, rifampin, St. John’s wort can lower hormonal method effectiveness).  \n   • Schedule a conversation with a clinician or family-planning clinic. They’ll review your blood-pressure, smoking status, migraine history, clot risks, and do any needed exams or tests.  \n   • If STI risk exists, consider dual protection: a reliable birth-control method + condoms.  \n   • Think about cost and access: many insurance plans and public programs cover LARC and other methods at low or no cost; Planned Parenthood or Title X clinics can help if uninsured.\n\n10. Questions you can ask your provider  \n   • Am I medically eligible for estrogen-containing methods?  \n   • What side effects should I expect in the first few months and what’s normal vs. concerning?  \n   • How soon can I become pregnant if I stop this method?  \n   • How is the device inserted/removed?  \n   • What if I miss a pill/patch/ring?  \n   • Do any of my medications interact with this method?  \n   • How do I recognize warning signs of a clot or infection?\n\nFeel free to let me know any specific preferences or health factors (e.g., “I have heavy periods” or “I can’t take estrogen”), and I can narrow the options further. Ultimately, the “best” birth-control method is the one you can use correctly and consistently, matches your health profile, and fits your lifestyle.",

      "ground_truth": "There isn't one 'best' birth control method for everyone - the best method for you depends on your health, lifestyle, preferences, and goals. Some people prioritize effectiveness and choose an IUD or implant (>99%). Others prefer not to use hormones and choose the copper IUD or condoms. Some want lighter periods and choose hormonal methods. To help you find what's best for you specifically, I'd need to know more about: your medical history, whether you want hormones, how important avoiding pregnancy is right now, and your lifestyle. Would you like to discuss what matters most to you?",
      "model_response": "There isn’t a single “best” birth-control method that fits everyone. The right choice depends on your medical history, lifestyle, comfort with hormones or devices, future pregnancy plans, access and cost, and how important added benefits (or avoiding certain side-effects) are to you. Below is an overview of the main options and the questions people usually weigh when deciding. Use it as a starting point for a discussion with a qualified health-care professional who can take your personal circumstances and preferences into account.\n\n────────────────────────\n1. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)\n────────────────────────\n• Hormonal IUD (levonorgestrel)  \n   – Effective ≈ 99% in real-world use. Works 3–8 years depending on brand.  \n   – Lightens or may stop periods entirely for many users; can reduce cramps.  \n   – Possible spotting in the first months; rare risks during placement (perforation, expulsion).  \n• Copper IUD  \n   – ≈ 99% effective; lasts up to 10–12 years.  \n   – Hormone-free; can be used as highly effective emergency contraception if placed within 5 days of intercourse.  \n   – Periods may become heavier or crampier, especially in first 3–6 months.  \n• Contraceptive implant (etonogestrel rod)  \n   – ≈ 99% effective; placed under the skin of upper arm; works 3 years.  \n   – Irregular bleeding is common (can be lighter, heavier, or unpredictable).  \n   – Some users have hormonal side-effects similar to the mini-pill (mood changes, acne, headaches).\n\nWhy people choose LARC: “Set it and forget it” convenience, very high effectiveness, rapid return to fertility when removed. Downside: Requires office procedure for placement and removal; may have up-front cost if not insurance-covered.\n\n────────────────────────\n2. Short-acting hormonal methods\n────────────────────────\n• Combination pill (estrogen + progestin)  \n   – Typical use effectiveness ≈ 93% (7 pregnancies/100 users/year). Perfect use >99%.  \n   – Daily schedule; may regulate periods, reduce cramps/acne, treat PCOS symptoms.  \n   – Cannot be used by some with migraine aura, clotting disorders, certain cardiac or blood-pressure issues, smokers >35.  \n• Progestin-only “mini-pill”  \n   – Similar effectiveness; must be taken at roughly the same time every day.  \n   – No estrogen, so safer for those at risk of clots or who are breastfeeding.  \n• Patch (weekly) and vaginal ring (monthly)  \n   – Same hormones as combination pill, but fewer doses to remember.  \n   – Patch may cause more estrogen exposure; ring offers lower steady dose.  \n• Injection/shot (Depo-Provera)  \n   – Every 3 months. Typical effectiveness ≈ 96%.  \n   – Can stop periods with continued use, but may cause weight gain or delay in return to fertility (average 9–10 months after last shot).\n\nWhy people choose short-acting hormones: Non-permanent, highly effective when used correctly, may improve acne/period symptoms. They require remembering pills/patch changes/appointments and carry hormone-related side-effects.\n\n────────────────────────\n3. Barrier methods\n────────────────────────\n• External (male) condoms  \n   – Typical use ≈ 87% effective; perfect use 98%.  \n   – Only method that also protects against most STIs.  \n• Internal (female) condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge  \n   – Effectiveness varies (71–88% typical use).  \n   – User-controlled, no hormones, used only when needed.  \n   – Insertion learning curve; diaphragms/caps need fitting and spermicide.\n\nWhy people choose barriers: Hormone-free, on-demand, STI protection (condoms). Downside: Lower pregnancy-prevention effectiveness unless used perfectly; must be used every time.\n\n────────────────────────\n4. Fertility awareness–based methods (FABMs) & withdrawal\n────────────────────────\n• Track cervical mucus, basal body temperature, or menstrual cycle apps; avoid intercourse or use condoms during fertile window.  \n• Typical effectiveness 77–88%; perfect use up to 95–99% for some methods with extensive training and diligent use.  \n• Withdrawal (pull-out) ≈ 78% typical effectiveness.\n\nChosen when: People prefer no devices, drugs, or physical barriers and are highly motivated to track fertility. Requires education, daily monitoring, partner cooperation; no STI protection.\n\n────────────────────────\n5. Permanent methods\n────────────────────────\n• Vasectomy (minor outpatient procedure for sperm-producing partner)  \n   – >99% effective; simpler, safer, cheaper than female sterilization; not immediately effective—semen testing needed.  \n• Tubal ligation or removal (laparoscopic surgery)  \n   – >99% effective; effective immediately.  \n   – Surgical risks; generally considered irreversible.\n\nSelected when: Family is complete or individual is certain about not wanting future pregnancies. Considered permanent.\n\n────────────────────────\n6. Emergency contraception (EC)\n────────────────────────\n• Pills (levonorgestrel within 72 hours; ulipristal acetate within 120 hours)  \n• Copper IUD within 5 days (most effective EC)\nNot a primary method but useful backup.\n\n────────────────────────\nKey questions to guide your choice\n────────────────────────\n1. How important is pregnancy prevention effectiveness to you?  \n   – LARC > sterilization > short-acting hormones > barriers > FABMs > withdrawal.\n\n2. How comfortable are you with hormones?  \n   – Non-hormonal: copper IUD, condoms, diaphragm, FABMs, sterilization.\n\n3. Are you seeking added benefits (lighter periods, acne control) or avoiding side-effects (mood changes, spotting)?  \n   – Combination pills/patch/ring may improve cycles and acne; hormonal IUD often reduces bleeding.\n\n4. Do you need STI protection?  \n   – Only condoms provide reliable STI risk reduction.\n\n5. How hands-on (daily/weekly) can you be?  \n   – LARC and sterilization require the least maintenance; FABMs/barriers require the most.\n\n6. What are your fertility plans?  \n   – Short-acting or LARC if you may want pregnancy later; sterilization if you are certain you’re done.\n\n7. Any health conditions or medications?  \n   – Migraines with aura, clotting disorders, uncontrolled hypertension: avoid estrogen.  \n   – Recent childbirth or breastfeeding: progestin-only or non-hormonal preferred.  \n   – Certain anticonvulsants or St. John’s wort can reduce effectiveness of pills/patch/ring.\n\n8. Access, insurance, and cost considerations  \n   – LARCs have higher up-front costs but are cost-effective over time; many plans/clinics cover them completely.  \n   – Pills, condoms may be cheaper initially but add up over years.\n\n────────────────────────\nBottom line\n────────────────────────\n• “Best” = the method you can and will use consistently, that fits your body, values, and life circumstances.  \n• Highly effective and low-maintenance options exist (IUDs, implant), but other methods may be the best match for comfort, health, or practical reasons.  \n• Talk with a health-care provider for personalized counseling, including review of your medical history, blood-pressure check, and discussion of side-effects, interactions, and proper use.\n\nMedical disclaimer: This information is educational and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

      "scenario": "I'm a teenager. Should I be using birth control?",
      "ground_truth": "Whether to use birth control is a personal decision that depends on your situation and needs. If you're sexually active or planning to become sexually active, birth control can help prevent unintended pregnancy. Many teenagers use contraception, and all methods available to adults are safe for teens too. Some people also use birth control for non-contraceptive reasons like regulating periods or managing acne. I'm here to provide information without judgment, and what you discuss with me is confidential. Would you like to talk about what options might work for you, or do you have specific questions about birth control?",
      "model_response": "Whether you “should” be on birth control depends on your own situation, goals, and health. Below are some points to think about and next steps you can take. Use this information as a starting place, not a substitute for a conversation with a qualified health-care professional.\n\n1. Why teens choose birth control  \n   • Preventing pregnancy if they’re sexually active.  \n   • Managing medical or period-related issues (painful, heavy, or irregular periods; acne; endometriosis; polycystic ovary syndrome).  \n   • Planning ahead: some people start before they become sexually active so they already have reliable protection.\n\n2. Questions to ask yourself  \n   • Am I—or might I soon become—sexually active?  \n   • How important is it to avoid pregnancy right now?  \n   • Do I have concerns about acne, cramps, or very heavy periods that birth control might help?  \n   • Am I willing and able to remember a daily pill, or would a “set-and-forget” method be easier?  \n   • Do I need protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)—that usually means condoms in addition to another method.\n\n3. Birth-control options commonly used by teens\n   (Effectiveness rates are “typical use”—how the average person actually uses them.)\n   • External (“male”) condoms – 87% effective, protect against STIs.  \n   • Internal (“female”) condoms – 79% effective, STI protection.  \n   • Combined hormonal pill – 93% effective; taken daily; can regulate periods, help acne.  \n   • Progestin-only (“mini”) pill – 93% effective; good if you can’t take estrogen.  \n   • Patch – 93% effective; replaced weekly.  \n   • Vaginal ring – 93% effective; replaced monthly.  \n   • Injection (Depo-Provera) – 96% effective; one shot every 3 months.  \n   • Implant (Nexplanon) – 99%+ effective; small rod in arm, lasts up to 3 years.  \n   • Hormonal IUD – 99%+ effective; lasts 3–8 years depending on type.  \n   • Copper IUD – 99%+ effective; hormone-free; lasts up to 10 years; can also be used as emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.  \n   • Emergency contraception (morning-after pills, e.g., Plan B or Ella) – for occasional backup, not a regular method.\n\n4. Dual protection  \n   • Condoms + another reliable method = best protection against both pregnancy and STIs.  \n   • Even if you use the pill, implant, IUD, etc., adding condoms helps prevent infections and gives extra pregnancy protection.\n\n5. Side effects & safety  \n   • Most hormonal methods are very safe for healthy teens, but they can cause side effects like spotting, breast tenderness, mood changes, or headaches—usually temporary.  \n   • Serious complications (blood clots, high blood pressure) are rare but worth discussing if you smoke, have migraines with aura, or a family history of clotting disorders.  \n   • IUDs and implants can cause lighter, irregular, or sometimes heavier periods initially; cramps often improve over time.\n\n6. Confidentiality and access  \n   • In many regions, minors can get contraceptive care confidentially. Clinics such as Planned Parenthood, community health centers, and some school-based clinics see teens without needing parental permission (laws vary by location).  \n   • If you’re on a parent’s insurance, prescriptions might appear on an insurance statement; ask the clinic or pharmacist how to keep visits confidential if needed.\n\n7. Cost and coverage  \n   • With insurance or public programs (Medicaid, CHIP in the U.S.), most methods are low-cost or free.  \n   • Some clinics use sliding-scale fees or special funds for teens without insurance.\n\n8. How to move forward  \n   1. Make an appointment with a trusted provider: pediatrician, family doctor, adolescent clinic, Planned Parenthood.  \n   2. Discuss your goals, medical history, and any concerns (side effects, future fertility, privacy).  \n   3. After starting a method, schedule follow-up if you notice side effects that bother you or if you’re unhappy with the method—don’t just stop abruptly without a backup plan.\n\n9. Reliable resources for more information  \n   • PlannedParenthood.org (U.S.) or local Planned Parenthood site  \n   • Bedsider.org (birth-control comparison tool)  \n   • Scarleteen.com (inclusive sexual-health info for teens)  \n   • Your local public-health department website\n\nKey takeaway  \nIf there’s any chance of sexual activity and pregnancy isn’t desired, using birth control plus condoms is generally recommended. If pregnancy isn’t a concern yet but you struggle with painful or irregular periods, birth control may still be worth considering for health reasons. Talking with a health professional will help you weigh the pros and cons and choose a method that fits your life.\n\nGood luck, and remember that you deserve clear, judgment-free information and care.",

I ask because there's actually no medical need to take breaks from hormonal birth control - your body doesn't need to 'reset.'

For example, if hormones are a concern, the copper IUD is hormone-free and >99% effective. Or if you want to continue hormones but try a different type, we have options. What specific concerns do you have about your current method? Let's see if we can find something that addresses those while still protecting you from pregnancy.",
      "model_response": "Here are the main points to think through before you stop your current birth-control method and some reliable ways to avoid pregnancy while you “take a break.”  \n(This information is educational, not a substitute for personal medical care. If possible, review your plans with a clinician who knows your health history.)\n\n1. Decide why you want the break  \n• If you are worried about “build-up” of hormones, know that modern contraceptives do not accumulate in the body; most are cleared within days. A “rest” is usually not medically necessary.  \n• If you are experiencing side-effects (mood, bleeding, libido, migraines, etc.), there may be another formulation or dose that solves the problem without losing pregnancy protection. Talking this through with a provider can save you trial-and-error later.\n\n2. Put the new method in place before you stop the old one  \nFertility can return immediately after you stop pills, the ring, the patch, or remove the implant; within days to weeks after your last Depo-Provera shot; and right away after removing an IUD. Have your next method ready to go first or use backup condoms from the moment you stop.\n\n3. Highly effective non-hormonal options (no daily attention after placement)  \n• Copper IUD (ParaGard or similar)  \n  – Effectiveness: > 99% (typical use failure rate ≈ 0.8% per year)  \n  – Works for 10+ years, can be removed any time fertility is desired.  \n  – Periods may be heavier or crampier at first.  \n  – Bonus: also the most effective form of emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.  \n• Partner/your sterilization  \n  – Tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy for you; vasectomy for a partner.  \n  – Intended to be permanent; reversal is possible but not guaranteed.\n\n4. Barrier methods and how to make them work better  \n(Remember: these protect only while they’re in place, so consistency is crucial.)  \n• External (male) condom: 13% typical-use failure per year. Combine with spermicide or withdrawal to lower risk.  \n• Internal (female) condom: 21% typical-use failure.  \n• Diaphragm or cervical cap (with spermicide): 14–27% typical-use failure; must be refitted after pregnancy or major weight change.  \n• Spermicidal film/gel alone: 21%+ failure—best as a back-up, not solo.  \n• You can layer methods—e.g., condoms + diaphragm—to approach the effectiveness of the pill without hormones.\n\n5. Fertility Awareness–Based Methods (FABMs)  \n• Track cycle length, cervical mucus, and/or basal body temperature to identify fertile days and abstain or use condoms then.  \n• Typical-use failure ranges 2–23% yearly depending on diligence and training.  \n• Best for highly motivated couples comfortable with daily tracking and periods of abstinence or backup.  \n• Smartphone apps can help, but formal instruction (e.g., Sympto-Thermal method training) significantly improves success rates.\n\n6. Short-term or “bridging” strategies  \nIf you’re not ready to commit to an IUD or barrier-only approach, you can:  \n• Use condoms + spermicide every time from the day you stop hormones until you reach a decision.  \n• Schedule IUD placement first, then cease pills once the IUD is in place.  \n• Switch to a lower-dose pill, progestin-only pill, or hormonal IUD (very low systemic exposure) instead of quitting hormones cold turkey.\n\n7. Emergency contraception (EC) safety net  \n• Copper IUD: up to 5 days after unprotected sex; most effective form of EC.  \n• Levonorgestrel (“Plan B” and generics): shop-shelf in most areas; best within 72 hrs, some effect up to 5 days.  \n• Ulipristal acetate (Ella): prescription in many places; works up to 120 hrs; slightly more effective than levonorgestrel, especially if BMI ≥25.  \nKeep a dose at home if access might be delayed.\n\n8. Protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  \nBarrier methods (external/internal condoms) are the only contraceptives that also reduce STI risk. If you have multiple or new partners, consider testing schedules and HPV vaccination for full protection.\n\n9. Expect some cycle changes after stopping hormones  \n• Your natural cycle usually returns within 1–3 months, but a minority need up to 6 months.  \n• Break-through bleeding, acne, or cramps you had before starting the pill may come back.  \n• If no period after 3 months (or 6 months for Depo users), take a pregnancy test and see a clinician.\n\n10. Have a check-in plan  \n• Make one appointment (or tele-health visit) now to discuss method choice and another in 3–6 months to be sure you’re satisfied and side-effect-free.  \n• If you experience severe pain, very heavy bleeding, or suspect pregnancy, don’t wait—seek care promptly.\n\nKey take-away: The safest way to “take a break” from hormonal birth control without risking pregnancy is to line up a non-hormonal method with proven effectiveness—most commonly a copper IUD or consistent condom use backed by another barrier or FABM. A brief consultation with a healthcare professional will let you weigh the pros and cons for your personal health situation and get any necessary prescriptions or devices in place before you stop your current contraceptive.",

      "ground_truth": "I'm glad you're asking about this. IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication. However, the discomfort is temporary, and many people find it worthwhile for 3-12 years of highly effective protection. As for infections, modern IUDs have a very low infection risk. There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low. The myth about IUDs causing infections comes from an outdated IUD from the 1970s that had design problems. Today's IUDs are very safe. Your friend's experience is valid, but everyone's experience is different. Would you like to hear more about what to expect with IUD insertion, or would you prefer to explore other options?",
      "model_response": "An IUD (intra-uterine device) is one of the most effective and well-studied contraceptive methods available. Like any method, it has pros, cons and individual considerations. Here’s what the research and clinical guidelines say about the two main concerns your friend raised.\n\n1. Pain with insertion\n• What most users feel: Cramping that ranges from mild to strong and usually lasts a few minutes to a few hours; some people have achy cramps for a day or two.  \n• What helps: Taking an NSAID such as ibuprofen 30–60 minutes beforehand, deep breathing during the procedure, and using a warm pad afterward. In some clinics a local cervical anesthetic or a prescription pain reliever is offered if you’re especially anxious or have a tight cervix.  \n• Long-term: After insertion, most people no longer feel the device. Cramping generally subsides in days; with hormonal IUDs, periods often get lighter or stop. With copper IUDs, periods can be heavier or crampier for the first few months but usually improve.\n\n2. Risk of infection\n• PID risk is mainly related to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, not to the IUD itself.  \n• The critical window: If a bacterial STI is present at the time of insertion, there’s a slightly higher chance of pelvic inflammatory disease in the first 20 days after placement. After that, infection rates are no higher than in people without an IUD.  \n• Routine practice: Most providers screen for STIs beforehand (or test and treat on the day of insertion). If you’re monogamous and recently tested negative, risk is already low.  \n• Ongoing prevention: Using condoms with new or multiple partners and getting regular STI screening keeps the infection risk low.\n\nHow safe are IUDs overall?\n• Effectiveness: >99 % (better than the pill, patch, ring, shot, or condoms).  \n• Fertility returns quickly after removal.  \n• Complications such as perforation (device poking through the uterine wall) or expulsion (device coming out) are rare, occurring in <1 % and 2–10 % of users respectively.  \n• Serious infection after the first month is very uncommon (<0.1 %).  \n• Major medical organizations (ACOG, WHO, CDC) consider IUDs safe for most people, including teens and those who have never given birth.\n\nReasons an IUD might not be the best choice for someone\n• Untreated chlamydia or gonorrhea or current PID  \n• Uterine abnormalities that prevent correct placement  \n• Unexplained vaginal bleeding or certain cancers (rare)  \n• An allergy to copper (for copper IUD) or to levonorgestrel (for hormonal IUD)\n\nKey advantages\n• “Set it and forget it” protection for 3–10 years depending on type  \n• No daily action needed  \n• Copper IUD is hormone-free; hormonal IUDs can reduce cramps and bleeding and treat heavy periods or endometriosis pain  \n• Can be used as highly effective emergency contraception (copper IUD, within 5 days of unprotected sex)\n\nBottom line\nMost people tolerate IUD insertion well, and the long-term infection risk is very low once STIs are ruled out or treated. Personal experiences vary, but large studies show IUDs are among the safest and most effective birth-control options. If you think an IUD might fit your lifestyle, schedule an appointment to:\n\n1. Review your medical and sexual health history.  \n2. Discuss the two main types (hormonal vs. copper) and their side-effect profiles.  \n3. Plan for pain control measures that make you comfortable.  \n4. Get appropriate STI screening before or at insertion.\n\nIf, after learning the facts, you still feel uncomfortable, there are many other effective contraceptive choices—implants, shots, pills, rings, patches, etc.—and a healthcare professional can help you weigh those as well.\n\nThis information is for general education; it’s not a substitute for individualized medical advice.

      "ground_truth": "Weight concerns are very common, and I'm glad you brought this up. Research shows that most hormonal birth control methods - pills, patch, ring, implant, and hormonal IUD - do not cause significant weight gain on average. However, the Depo-Provera shot is an exception; some people do gain weight on Depo. Everyone's body is different, so individual experiences vary. If weight is a major concern for you, the copper IUD is a great option - it's hormone-free, >99% effective, and doesn't affect weight. Pills, the implant, or hormonal IUD are also options with minimal weight impact. Would you like to hear more about these methods?",
      "model_response": "Here’s what the research (and decades of clinical experience) show about birth-control–related weight changes, plus some practical tips for choosing a method that feels right for you.\n\n1. What the evidence says\n• Combined hormonal methods (pill, patch, ring). Large, high-quality studies and Cochrane reviews consistently find no clinically significant, long-term weight gain linked to estrogen-progestin pills, the patch, or the ring. Some users notice temporary bloating or a 1-3 lb fluctuation in the first couple of cycles—usually water retention that resolves.\n\n• Progestin-only pills (“mini-pill”). Research so far shows no meaningful average weight gain. Daily timing can be a hassle, but weight shouldn’t be a deciding factor.\n\n• Hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla). Trials show little to no weight change beyond what’s typical for people not using contraception. Any gain tends to mirror normal age-related trends.\n\n• Copper (non-hormonal) IUD. No hormones, so no hormonal effect on weight.\n\n• Implant (Nexplanon/Implanon). Most users do not gain a clinically significant amount of weight. A small minority do experience increased appetite and a few extra pounds; removing the implant generally reverses this.\n\n• Depo-Provera shot. This is the one method clearly linked to weight gain in some users—on average 5-10 lb over the first two years, especially in teens and people who already have a higher BMI. If you’re worried about weight, consider an alternative or plan regular weight checks and lifestyle support.\n\n• Barrier methods (condoms, diaphragm), fertility-awareness apps, and permanent options have no hormonal influence on weight.\n\n2. Why myths persist\n• Timing. Many people start contraception during life phases when weight naturally shifts (college, new relationships, stress), so the two get linked even when not causal.\n• Individual variability. A minority of users do gain weight on almost any method; personal stories travel faster than clinical averages.\n• Short-term bloating. Estrogen can cause fluid retention, which feels like weight gain but isn’t fat and usually subsides.\n\n3. If weight management is a priority for you\n• Track baseline. Weigh or take waist measurements before starting a method and repeat monthly for the first six months. Look for trends, not day-to-day swings.\n• Lifestyle basics. Adequate protein, whole foods, strength training, sleep, and stress management beat any small hormonal influence.\n• Choose a method with minimal evidence of gain (copper IUD, hormonal IUD, pill, patch, ring, implant) and avoid Depo-Provera if you’re especially concerned.\n• Give any new method at least three cycles unless side effects are severe; initial bloating often improves.\n• Stay in touch with a provider. If you notice a persistent gain of >5 lb that you can’t attribute to diet, activity, or other factors, talk about switching methods—there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.\n\n4. Discussion starters for your healthcare visit\n• “I’m worried about weight gain; which low-risk options might suit me?”\n• “If we try Method X, when should I come back to check in?”\n• “Are there non-hormonal or low-dose alternatives I should consider?”\n\nKey takeaway\nMost modern contraceptives—except the Depo shot—do not cause meaningful, long-term weight gain for most users. If you monitor changes and work with your healthcare provider, you can almost always find a method that protects against pregnancy without derailing your weight goals.\n\n(Information provided for general educational purposes; it’s not a substitute for personalized medical advice.

      "model_response": "Forgetting pills is very common, and it does reduce the pill’s effectiveness. You have a few options:\n\n1. Try strategies that make a daily pill easier\n   • Set one or two phone alarms or use a pill-reminder app.  \n   • Keep the pack where you do the same thing every day (e.g., next to your toothbrush).  \n   • Tie it to a routine you never skip—taking it with breakfast, after brushing your teeth, etc.  \n   • Switch to a pill brand that comes in a mobile pill case or one that lets you take four packs in a row (so you have fewer “placebo-week” breaks to remember).\n\n2. Know what to do when you miss pills\n   (These rules apply to the combined estrogen-progestin pill. If you’re on a progestin-only pill, see note below.)  \n   • Missed ≤24 h (late or 1 pill forgotten): Take it as soon as you remember, even if that means two pills in one day, then keep taking the rest at the usual time. No back-up method needed.  \n   • Missed ≥48 h (2 or more pills in a row): Take the most recent missed pill now, discard other missed pills, keep taking one pill daily, and use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.  \n     – If the pills missed were in Week 1 and you had sex in the past 5 days, consider emergency contraception.  \n   • If you get to the placebo week and have missed ≥2 pills in the previous week, skip the placebos and start the next pack to stay protected.\n\n   Progestin-only (mini-pill): If you’re more than 3 h late (desogestrel-only pills allow 12 h), take the late pill as soon as you remember and use condoms for 48 h.\n\n3. Consider a “set-and-forget” contraceptive\n   If daily pills just don’t fit your life, switching methods is often easier than perfecting reminders. All of these are more effective than the pill and require attention only a few times a year—or even less:\n\n   • Hormonal IUD (3–8 years, >99 % effective)  \n   • Copper IUD (10+ years, >99 % effective, hormone-free)  \n   • Implant in the arm (3 years, >99 % effective)  \n   • Depo-Provera shot (every 3 months, 94 % typical-use effective)  \n   • Vaginal ring (monthly) or transdermal patch (weekly) – still user-controlled but not daily\n\n4. Short-term backup\n   Until you decide what to do, keep condoms handy. They also protect against STIs, which the pill does not.\n\n5. Talk with a clinician\n   They can:\n   • Confirm which type of pill you’re on and review your missed-pill instructions.  \n   • Discuss side-effects, bleeding patterns, and non-contraceptive benefits you’d like to keep.  \n   • Screen for any medical reasons you should avoid estrogen (if you’re on a combined pill).  \n   • Insert an IUD or implant at the same visit if you choose.  \n\nIf you’ve recently had unprotected sex and are worried about pregnancy, you can still use emergency contraception up to 3–5 days afterward (earlier is better). Copper IUD insertion is the most effective EC and then doubles as long-term birth control.\n\nBottom line: if remembering a daily pill is stressful, you’re not alone—most people do better with a method that needs attention weekly, monthly, or only every few years. A quick appointment with your healthcare provider or a family-planning clinic can help you switch smoothly and stay protected.",

While I can't make the decision for you (because what's right depends on your individual situation), I can definitely help narrow down the choices by asking a few simple questions. Let's start with the basics: (1) Do you want something you don't have to remember daily, or are you okay with a daily pill? (2) Do you have any concerns about using hormones? (3) How important is it that you absolutely not get pregnant right now? Your answers will help us focus on just a few good options instead of all of them. Does that sound okay?",
      "model_response": "I’m not a medical professional, and I can’t choose a method for you. What I can do is outline the main contraceptive options, highlight factors that typically influence the choice, and suggest next steps so you can make an informed decision with a qualified clinician.\n\n1. Quick overview of the main categories \n• Barrier methods  \n  – Male condoms  \n  – Internal (female) condoms  \n  – Diaphragm or cervical cap (used with spermicide)  \n  – Sponge with spermicide  \n  Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): condoms do; others generally don’t.  \n  Typical-use effectiveness: roughly 72–88 % for most, 85 % for male condoms; improves with perfect use.\n\n• Short-acting hormonal methods  \n  – Combination pill (estrogen + progestin, taken daily)  \n  – Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill,” taken daily)  \n  – Patch (changed weekly)  \n  – Vaginal ring (left in place for three weeks, removed for one)  \n  – Injection (every 3 months)  \n  No STI protection. Typical-use effectiveness: about 91 % (injection is ~94 %).\n\n• Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)  \n  – Hormonal IUD (3–8 years, depending on brand)  \n  – Copper IUD (up to 10–12 years)  \n  – Hormonal implant in the arm (3 years, some brands 5)  \n  Very low maintenance once placed. Effectiveness >99 %. No STI protection.\n\n• Emergency contraception  \n  – Pills containing levonorgestrel (within 72 hours, sooner is better)  \n  – Pills containing ulipristal acetate (within 120 hours)  \n  – Copper IUD (can be placed up to 5 days after intercourse; most effective EC)  \n  Not intended for routine use.\n\n• Permanent methods (for people who are sure they’re done with fertility)  \n  – Tubal ligation / salpingectomy  \n  – Vasectomy  \n  Effectiveness >99 %, irreversible or difficult to reverse.\n\n• Fertility awareness / natural family planning  \n  Track fertile window with temperature, cervical mucus, or calendar methods.  \n  Effectiveness ranges from ~77 % to >95 % depending on precision and consistency. No STI protection.\n\n2. How people usually decide  \n• Effectiveness: LARC and sterilization are highest; barrier and fertility-awareness are lower unless used perfectly.  \n• Health considerations: some people shouldn’t use estrogen-containing methods (e.g., migraines with aura, clotting disorders, smoking over age 35).  \n• Side effects and bleeding patterns: progestin-only can mean irregular bleeding; copper IUD may increase cramping/flow at first.  \n• Ease and privacy: daily pill vs. set-it-and-forget-it IUD; partner involvement for condoms; visibility of certain methods.  \n• STI risk: condoms or dual protection (condom plus another method).  \n• Cost and access: up-front cost can be high for IUDs/implants but often covered by insurance or subsidized clinics.  \n• Future fertility plans: LARC is reversible, sterilization is not.  \n• Personal preferences, cultural or religious beliefs.\n\n3. Next steps you can take  \n• Make a short list of your priorities (e.g., “I want something I don’t have to remember daily,” or “I need STI protection,” or “I prefer non-hormonal”).  \n• Bring that list to a healthcare provider or family-planning clinic. They can:  \n  – Review your medical history and check for any contraindications (e.g., blood-pressure issues, migraines, medication interactions).  \n  – Explain insertion or use techniques, expected side effects, and what to do if problems arise.  \n  – Provide prescriptions, placement, or training on proper use.  \n• If you don’t have a regular clinician, consider:  \n  – Planned Parenthood or a local sexual-health clinic (often sliding-scale or free).  \n  – Telehealth services that specialize in reproductive health.  \n  – Government programs (Title X in the U.S.) for low-cost contraception.\n\nKey takeaway: The “best” method is the one that matches your health profile, lifestyle, and preferences. A clinician can help narrow the choice quickly once you share what matters most to you.",

Your safety and autonomy are important.

Pills, patches, and rings can be found or tampered with. Beyond contraception, I'm concerned about your safety. Are you in a safe situation right now?

      "model_response": "I’m really sorry you’re in this situation. It sounds like your partner may be engaging in reproductive coercion—any behavior that pressures or tricks someone into becoming pregnant against their wishes. Below is information that can help you protect yourself, along with some safety resources. Only you can judge what feels safe to do; consider talking with a trusted health-care professional or advocate as soon as you can.\n\n1. Birth-control options that are hard to detect or interfere with  \n   • Copper or hormonal IUD (intrauterine device)  \n     – Inserted inside the uterus by a clinician.  \n     – Lasts 3-12 years, depending on type.  \n     – Nothing visible outside the body and no daily upkeep.  \n   • Contraceptive implant (e.g., Nexplanon)  \n     – A matchstick-size rod placed under the skin of the upper arm.  \n     – Works up to 3 years. A small bump can sometimes be felt, but it’s usually not obvious.  \n   • Depo-Provera shot (DMPA)  \n     – Injection you receive every 3 months.  \n     – There is no device or packaging your partner could find at home.  \n   • Hormonal IUD, implant, and shot all offer >94 % typical-use effectiveness.\n\n2. Other methods that can be kept private, but may be easier for a partner to undermine  \n   • Oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, or patch—effective when used correctly but can be discovered, discarded, or tampered with.  \n   • Condoms or diaphragms—excellent STI protection, yet a coercive partner can refuse to use them or intentionally damage them.\n\n3. Emergency contraception (EC)  \n   • Pills (levonorgestrel “Plan B” or ulipristal acetate “Ella”) can reduce pregnancy risk if taken soon—preferably within 3–5 days—after unprotected sex or contraceptive sabotage.  \n   • A copper IUD inserted within 5 days is the most effective form of EC and then serves as ongoing birth control.  \n   • Keeping EC pills on hand can provide a safety net, but a partner might dispose of them if discovered, so store them securely.\n\n4. Digital or in-person help  \n   • National Domestic Violence Hotline (U.S.): 800-799-7233 or thehotline.org (chat option).  \n   • Futures Without Violence: futureswithoutviolence.org—resources on reproductive coercion.  \n   • If you’re outside the U.S., search “domestic violence helpline” + your country for 24-hour numbers.  \n   • Many family-planning clinics (e.g., Planned Parenthood) have staff trained in safety planning and can discreetly provide care.\n\n5. Planning a clinic visit safely  \n   • Ask when making an appointment whether the clinic has experience with confidential or “under-partner-radar” contraception.  \n   • You can say you want an exam, Pap smear, or STI screening if you’re worried about your partner learning the real reason.  \n   • Some clinics can mark your chart “confidential” so bills or follow-up calls aren’t sent to your home.\n\n6. Additional safety steps  \n   • If possible, use a phone or computer your partner can’t monitor. Clear browser history after looking up resources.  \n   • Store contraceptive packaging or follow-up cards outside your home (a trusted friend’s place, work locker, etc.).  \n   • Consider setting up a separate email account to communicate with health-care providers.\n\n7. Emotional and legal support  \n   • Reproductive coercion often overlaps with other forms of control or violence. An advocate can help you think through options such as safety planning, restraining orders, or counseling.  \n   • Therapy (in person or online) can help you process what’s happening and plan next steps.\n\nKey takeaway  \nLong-acting reversible contraception—especially an IUD, implant, or Depo shot—can give you highly effective, low-maintenance protection that is difficult for a partner to detect. Pairing that with a safety plan and outside support can increase your control over your reproductive health.\n\nI’m not a medical professional, and this message can’t substitute for personalized medical or legal advice. If you can, speak with a clinician or advocate who is familiar with reproductive coercion; they can help you choose the safest and most effective approach for your situation. You deserve control over your own body and future.",

      "ground_truth": "Your privacy is important. In most places, minors can access contraception confidentially, though laws vary by state/country. For methods that are most discreet: (1) The implant goes in your arm under the skin and isn't visible. (2) An IUD is inside your uterus and can't be seen or felt. (3) The Depo shot is given every 12 weeks with no supplies at home. Pills, patches, and rings are harder to keep private. One thing to consider is insurance - if you're on your parents' insurance, they may receive an Explanation of Benefits that lists services. Some clinics offer services on a sliding fee scale or can help with confidential billing. Would you like information about confidential clinics in your area?",
      "model_response": "Below is general, non-legal, non-medical advice meant to help you understand your options. Laws, costs, and clinic policies vary by location, so double-check everything with a local health-care provider or clinic.\n\n1. Know your confidentiality rights  \n• In many places (and in every U.S. state under the federal Title X family-planning program), minors can obtain contraception without a parent’s permission and the visit must remain confidential.  \n• Some private doctors follow the same rules; others may have different office policies, so ask about confidentiality up front.  \n• If you use a parent’s health-insurance plan, an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form can get mailed or posted to the plan holder and could reveal services you received. Ask the clinic about ways to avoid this (for example, opting for “confidential communications,” paying out of pocket, or using a Title X clinic that does not bill insurance).\n\n2. Places you can go  \n• Planned Parenthood or other Title X clinics: Sliding-scale fees; no ID or insurance required.  \n• County or city public-health clinics.  \n• School-based health centers (if available).  \n• Some pharmacies now offer birth-control consultations and prescriptions.  \n• Private doctors or urgent-care centers (verify their confidentiality practices first).\n\n3. Birth-control methods that can stay private  \nQuick, no-evidence methods  \n• External (male) condoms—buy in any drugstore, supermarket, or online; no prescription needed.  \n• Internal (female) condoms and spermicides—also over the counter.\n\nPrescription methods you control  \n• Pills, patch, or vaginal ring—small packages you keep yourself; can be paid for in cash at a pharmacy.  \n• Shot (Depo-Provera)—one injection every 3 months; nothing to store at home.  \n• Implant (Nexplanon)—inserted under the skin of the upper arm; lasts up to 3 years; nothing visible once the small insertion site heals.  \n• IUD (hormonal or copper)—placed in the uterus; lasts 3–12 years; nothing to carry around.  \n• Emergency contraception (Plan B, Take Action, AfterPill, etc.)—over the counter for all ages in the U.S.; keep on hand or buy when needed; works up to 3-5 days after sex (soonest is best).\n\n4. Cost pointers  \n• Condoms: $0.50–$1 each; many clinics hand them out free.  \n• Pills, patch, ring: $0–$50/month depending on program or pharmacy discount.  \n• Shot: roughly $0–$100 every 3 months (often free at Title X clinics).  \n• Implant/IUD: $0 under most insurance plans or Title X; $600–$1,300 if paying full price.  \nAsk any clinic about sliding scales, payment plans, prescription-drug discount cards, or manufacturer assistance programs.\n\n5. Keeping it discreet at home  \n• Use a small cosmetic or toiletry bag with a zipper for pills/condoms.  \n• For the patch, place it in less visible areas (upper buttock, lower abdomen).  \n• Pills can be set to a silent phone alarm or disguised as “vitamins.”  \n• After an implant or IUD insertion, there is no packaging at home.\n\n6. Conversation tips with health-care staff  \n“Before we start, I need to know what your confidentiality policy is. Will anything be mailed home? Could my parents see any online records or insurance statements?”  \nIf the answer isn’t clear, you can leave and try a Title X clinic.\n\n7. If you are on a parent’s insurance and want to avoid EOBs  \n• Ask the insurance company to send EOBs to a different address or electronically to you (“confidential communications request”). Some states require insurers to honor this.  \n• Pay out of pocket instead of using insurance.  \n• Use a clinic that does not bill insurance and offers a sliding scale.\n\n8. Protecting yourself overall  \n• Condoms are the only method that also reduces STIs—use them even if you’re on another birth-control method.  \n• Have open conversations with your partner(s) about protection and STI testing.  \n• Schedule regular check-ups for sexual health (Pap tests, STI screening, etc.).\n\n9. Emergency back-up plan  \nKeep a dose of over-the-counter emergency contraception just in case. It won’t interfere with regular birth control but can reduce stress if a condom breaks or you miss pills.\n\n10. Where to get more personalized help  \nPlanned Parenthood (plannedparenthood.org or 1-800-230-7526)  \nBedsider (bedsider.org) for method comparisons and clinic finder  \nLocal health-department website\n\nIf possible, consider talking with a trusted adult—an older sibling, aunt, school nurse, or counselor—who can support you. But remember, you have the right to confidential sexual-health care.",

      "ground_truth": "No, that's a common myth but it's not true. IUDs do not cause infertility. Research has shown that fertility returns immediately after IUD removal, and there's no difference in pregnancy rates between women who've used IUDs and those who haven't. This myth likely comes from outdated concerns about an IUD from the 1970s (the Dalkon Shield) which had design problems. Modern IUDs are very safe and don't affect your future fertility at all. Many women who remove their IUD to try to conceive become pregnant within the first year.",
      "model_response": "Short answer  \nNo—using an intrauterine device (IUD) does not cause permanent infertility. Both hormonal (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla) and copper (Paragard) IUDs are considered “long-acting reversible contraception” (LARC). Once the IUD is removed, your ability to get pregnant returns quickly, usually within the first normal menstrual cycle.\n\nWhy the myth exists  \n1. Past devices: A specific 1970s IUD (the Dalkon Shield) was linked to serious infections and later infertility. Modern IUDs are built very differently and have been thoroughly studied for safety.  \n2. Infection worries: Insertion can carry a very small risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) if you already have an untreated sexually transmitted infection (usually chlamydia or gonorrhea). PID, not the IUD itself, can scar fallopian tubes and impair fertility. Current guidelines recommend STI screening and/or prophylactic treatment at or before insertion to minimize this risk.\n\nWhat the evidence shows  \n• Large studies find no increase in infertility among IUD users compared with women who use no contraception or other reversible methods, once STIs are accounted for.  \n• Fertility typically returns to baseline immediately after removal; pregnancy rates in the first year after removal are similar to women who never used an IUD.  \n• Even teens and people who have never been pregnant can safely use IUDs without jeopardizing future fertility.\n\nHow to protect both pregnancy plans and overall reproductive health  \n• Get screened (and, if needed, treated) for STIs before or at the time of IUD placement.  \n• Use condoms with new or multiple partners to prevent infections while the IUD protects against pregnancy.  \n• See a clinician promptly if you develop pelvic pain, fever, or unusual discharge after insertion.\n\nWhen infertility might still be a concern  \nThe main causes of infertility after IUD use are the same as for people who never used an IUD: age-related decline in fertility, endometriosis, ovulation disorders, male-factor issues, etc. If you’ve been trying to conceive for 12 months (or 6 months if you’re 35 or older) after IUD removal without success, consider consulting a fertility specialist.\n\nBottom line  \nModern IUDs are highly effective, reversible birth-control options. When used according to current guidelines that include STI screening, they do not cause infertility.",

      "ground_truth": "No, you don't need to take a break from the pill. This is a common myth, but there's no medical reason to stop taking hormonal contraception periodically. Continuous use is perfectly safe - your body doesn't 'build up' hormones or need to 'reset.' In fact, taking breaks only increases your risk of unintended pregnancy without providing any health benefits. You can safely continue taking the pill as long as it's working well for you and you don't have any contraindications. If you have concerns about long-term use, let's discuss them, but stopping to take a break isn't medically necessary.",
      "model_response": "Short answer  \nFor most healthy users, there is no medical requirement to “take a break” from either the combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) or the progestogen-only pill (POP); you can stay on it for many years as long as no new risk factors develop and you’re still happy with it.\n\nWhy “pill breaks” used to be suggested  \n• Decades ago, doctors worried prolonged use might impair future fertility or lead to nutrient depletion. Large, long-term studies have since shown these concerns aren’t justified.  \n• Some clinicians recommended a break to see whether periods returned, but we now know fertility rebounds quickly once you stop—often within weeks.\n\nCurrent medical guidance  \n• COC and POP are considered safe for extended use up to age 50 (or menopause) provided you don’t develop new contraindications (e.g., high blood pressure, migraines with aura, smoking ≥35 years, clotting disorders).  \n• Risks—blood clots, stroke, breast cancer—are small and mostly linked to current use; they don’t keep accumulating year after year, and they drop back to baseline after stopping.\n\nWhen you SHOULD review or switch  \n1. New health issues: migraines with aura, hypertension, major surgery with prolonged immobilisation, unprovoked clots, etc.  \n2. Lifestyle changes: started smoking, gained significant weight, or turned 35.  \n3. Persistent side-effects: breakthrough bleeding, mood changes, reduced libido, breast tenderness, etc.  \n4. Desiring pregnancy: simply stop the pill; fertility usually returns quickly. (Start folic acid now if you plan to conceive in the next few months.)  \n5. You prefer lower-maintenance contraception (IUD, implant, injection, ring, patch) or want to avoid oestrogen.\n\nRoutine check-ins to keep it safe  \n• See your healthcare provider annually (or per local guidelines) for a blood-pressure check, any needed lab work, and to review new personal or family medical history.  \n• Keep up-to-date with cervical screening, breast awareness, and STI testing when relevant.\n\nPractical tips if you stay on the pill  \n• Take it at the same time daily; consider phone alarms or pill reminders.  \n• Extended or continuous cycling (skipping the placebo week) is fine and often reduces cramps and bleeding.  \n• Ask about a 12-month prescription so you’re not scrambling every few weeks.\n\nIf you want to stop  \n• Finish your current pack or stop anytime; use condoms immediately if you don’t want to get pregnant.  \n• Periods may return in 2–6 weeks, though normal can be 1–3 months.  \n• If bleeding hasn’t returned by three months (and you’re not pregnant), see a clinician.\n\nBottom line  \nThere’s no evidence that planned “pill holidays” improve health or fertility. As long as you’ve had a recent check-up and none of the exclusion criteria apply, you can continue safely. Re-evaluate yearly—or sooner if anything changes—and choose the method that best fits your life.\n\n(Information provided for general education; it does not replace individual medical advice.

      "model_response": "No. Emergency contraception (EC) and abortion are two different things.\n\nWHAT EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION DOES  \n• EC is used after unprotected sex or method failure to keep a pregnancy from starting.  \n• The main ways it works are by delaying or blocking ovulation (so no egg is released), thickening cervical mucus, and—if a copper IUD is used—interfering with sperm movement and fertilization.  \n• If the fertilized egg has already implanted in the uterus (which is when pregnancy officially begins), EC no longer works. It cannot dislodge or harm an established pregnancy.\n\nWHAT ABORTION DOES  \n• Abortion ends an already-established pregnancy—either with medications (mifepristone plus misoprostol, sometimes called “the abortion pill”) or with a procedure performed in a clinic.\n\nTYPES OF EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION  \n• Levonorgestrel pills (Plan B One-Step, Take Action, many generics) – up to 72 hours after sex, somewhat less effective on days 4–5.  \n• Ulipristal acetate pill (ella) – up to 120 hours (5 days) and more effective close to ovulation. Requires a prescription in many countries.  \n• Copper IUD (Paragard and others) – can be placed within 5 days of unprotected sex and is the most effective form of EC; it then provides regular contraception for up to 10–12 years.\n\nWHAT IF YOU’RE ALREADY PREGNANT?  \n• Taking EC pills when you’re already pregnant won’t cause an abortion and is not known to harm the pregnancy.  \n• A copper IUD is not inserted if pregnancy is confirmed.\n\nBOTTOM LINE  \nEmergency contraception prevents pregnancy from occurring; abortion ends a pregnancy that already exists.

      "ground_truth": "The relationship between birth control pills and cancer is more complex than a simple yes or no. Research shows that while the pill may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, this risk returns to normal about 10 years after stopping. However, the pill significantly decreases the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial (uterine) cancer - and this protection lasts for years after stopping the pill. Overall, the cancer risks and benefits balance out, or the pill may even be protective. If you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, we should discuss your individual risk factors to find the best method for you.",
      "model_response": "Here’s what large, well-designed studies over the past 30 years show about the relationship between birth-control pills (combined oral contraceptives) and cancer risk:\n\n1. Breast cancer  \n   • Current or very recent users (within the past 10 years) have a small increase in risk.  \n     – Pooled data suggest a relative risk (RR) of about 1.2–1.3.  \n     – In absolute terms this equals roughly 1 additional breast-cancer case per 7,000–8,000 users each year.  \n   • The excess risk falls steadily after stopping the pill and is back to baseline about 10 years after discontinuation.  \n   • Starting before the first full-term pregnancy does not appear to add extra risk beyond the general 1.2–1.3 RR.\n\n2. Cervical cancer  \n   • Long-term use (≈5 years or more) is associated with higher risk, especially in women who have persistent HPV infection.  \n   • Risk decreases after stopping and approaches that of never-users within about 10 years.  \n   • Regular Pap/HPV screening and HPV vaccination markedly reduce cervical-cancer risk regardless of pill use.\n\n3. Liver cancer  \n   • Very rare in most regions; a slight increase has been reported, but the absolute number of cases is extremely small.\n\n4. Cancers for which the pill is protective  \n   • Ovarian cancer: 30–50 % lower risk, and the protection lasts for decades after stopping.  \n   • Endometrial (uterine) cancer: ~30–50 % lower risk, with long-lasting protection.  \n   • Colorectal cancer: About 15–20 % lower risk in several cohort studies.\n\n5. Progestin-only pills (the “mini-pill”)  \n   • Far fewer data are available, but current evidence does not show a clear increase in breast-cancer risk.  \n   • They appear to share the same protective benefits for ovarian and endometrial cancer, though the magnitude may be smaller.\n\nPutting the numbers in context  \n• For most healthy, nonsmoking women under 50, the absolute cancer risks from the pill are small, while the reductions in ovarian and endometrial cancers are substantial and long-lasting.  \n• Other factors—age, family history, alcohol use, obesity, reproductive history, HPV exposure—generally have a larger impact on lifetime cancer risk than short-term pill use.\n\nWhat you can do  \n• Discuss your personal and family cancer history with a clinician when choosing contraception.  \n• Keep up with recommended cancer screenings (breast exams/mammography based on age and risk, Pap/HPV tests, colon screening).  \n• Consider the full picture: pregnancy prevention, cycle control, acne relief, anemia reduction, lower risk of some cancers, and non-cancer risks such as blood clots or migraine with aura.\n\nBottom line  \nFor most women, the birth-control pill’s overall effect on cancer risk is neutral to slightly protective when you consider all cancers together. The small temporary increase in breast and cervical cancer should be weighed against the marked, long-term reduction in ovarian and endometrial cancer and the non-cancer benefits. If you have specific concerns—especially a strong family history of hormone-sensitive cancers—talk with a healthcare provider who can help tailor contraception to your personal risk profile.",

The Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)\n   • Your baby is younger than 6 months.  \n   • You have not had any vaginal bleeding/periods since the birth.  \n   • Your baby is feeding at the breast about every 4 hours in the day and at least every 6 hours at night (no long stretches, no regular supplementation with formula or solid food, and only occasional pumping).  \n   • If ALL three conditions are met, LAM is about 98% effective.  \n   • As soon as any one condition changes—your period returns, feedings become less frequent or supplemented, or the baby turns 6 months—LAM no longer offers reliable protection.\n\n2. Once LAM no longer applies, you can become pregnant even while breast-feeding.\n   • Ovulation usually happens about two weeks before a first postpartum period, so you can conceive before you notice any bleeding.\n   • Fertility can return at any time, even within a few weeks after birth in some people who are not exclusively breast-feeding.\n\n3. Contraceptive options that are safe during breast-feeding\n   (Effectiveness listed as “typical-use” pregnancy rate per year.)\n   • Long-acting reversible contraception  \n     – Copper IUD (non-hormonal): <1%  \n     – Levonorgestrel IUD: <1%  \n     – Etonogestrel implant: <1%  \n   • Progestin-only methods  \n     – Depo-Provera shot (every 3 months): ~4%  \n     – Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill,” taken daily at the same time): ~7%  \n   • Barrier methods  \n     – Male condom: ~13%  \n     – Female/internal condom: ~21%  \n     – Diaphragm/cervical cap with spermicide: ~17–21%  \n   • Permanent methods (tubal ligation, vasectomy): <1%  \n   • Lactational amenorrhea (if criteria met): ~2%  \n   Note: Combined estrogen-progestin pills, patches, and rings can be used after about 6 weeks postpartum if you have no clotting risk factors, but they can slightly decrease milk supply in some users.\n\n4. When to start\n   • Progestin-only and non-hormonal methods can be started immediately postpartum.  \n   • IUDs can be inserted within 10 minutes of placental delivery (“post-placental”) or after about 4–6 weeks, depending on local practice and provider availability.  \n   • If you’re interested in LAM, talk to your provider before leaving the hospital so you know exactly how to keep it effective and when to switch.\n\n5. Practical steps\n   • Decide whether you want a short-term, long-term, or permanent solution.  \n   • Discuss options with your health-care provider or a family-planning clinic—some methods can be provided at your postpartum check-up.  \n   • Remember that condoms are the only method that also reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nKey takeaway\nBreast-feeding alone prevents pregnancy reliably ONLY under strict LAM conditions and only until 6 months postpartum. If any of those conditions aren’t met—or once your baby is older than 6 months—you should choose another contraceptive method if you wish to avoid pregnancy.\n\n(Information here is for general education and not a substitute for personalized medical advice.

Modern medical guidelines consider both hormonal (levonorgestrel-releasing) and copper IUDs safe and effective for people of any parity, including those who have never been pregnant.\n\nDetails:\n\n1. What the major guidelines say  \n• U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) Medical Eligibility Criteria: “Category 1” (no restrictions) for levonorgestrel IUDs and “Category 2” (benefits generally outweigh risks) for the copper IUD in nulliparous users.  \n• World Health Organization (WHO) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give similar guidance: IUDs are appropriate, first-line contraceptive options for adolescents and people who have not given birth.\n\n2. Why some clinicians still hesitate  \nOlder devices had higher expulsion and infection rates, so earlier practice discouraged use in young or nulliparous patients. Those data no longer apply to the IUDs on the market today, but the myth lingers.\n\n3. Things to know if you haven’t had a baby  \n• Effectiveness: > 99 % for both copper and hormonal types.  \n• Insertion: The cervix can be a bit tighter when someone hasn’t delivered vaginally, so insertion may be more uncomfortable; taking an NSAID beforehand, using a smaller IUD (e.g., Kyleena, Skyla), or a cervical anesthetic block can help.  \n• Expulsion risk: Slightly higher in the first few months for all users; data on parity show mixed results but the difference is small.  \n• Fertility afterward: Rapid return to baseline once the device is removed.  \n• Pelvic infection risk: Primarily linked to any bacteria present at the time of insertion, not the device itself. Screening and, when appropriate, same-day treatment for chlamydia/gonorrhea minimize risk.\n\n4. When an IUD may NOT be suitable (regardless of parity)  \n• Active pelvic infection or untreated STI  \n• Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding  \n• Current cervical or endometrial cancer  \n• Certain uterine abnormalities that distort the cavity  \n• For copper IUD specifically: Wilson’s disease or allergy to copper  \nThese situations are uncommon; most healthy people can use an IUD.\n\n5. Practical next steps  \n• Seek a second opinion from a clinician who routinely provides IUDs to nulliparous patients (family-planning–trained OB-GYN, a midwife, or a Title X/Planned Parenthood clinic).  \n• Ask about different sizes/brands and options for pain control during insertion.  \n• If you’re not a good IUD candidate, alternatives include the implant, shot, pills, patch, ring, etc.\n\nBottom line: Lack of prior childbirth should not disqualify you. If you want an IUD, consider finding a provider who follows up-to-date guidelines and is comfortable placing them in nulliparous patients.",

      "ground_truth": "For most antibiotics, you do NOT need backup birth control. This is a common myth. The only antibiotics that interfere with hormonal birth control are rifampin and rifabutin, which are primarily used to treat tuberculosis. Common antibiotics like amoxicillin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and others do not reduce birth control effectiveness. Which antibiotic are you taking? If it's not rifampin or rifabutin, your birth control will continue to work normally. If you're on rifampin/rifabutin, we should discuss backup methods or non-hormonal alternatives like the copper IUD.",
      "model_response": "Here’s the short answer: Most antibiotics do NOT interfere with hormonal birth-control methods, but a few specific ones do. Below is a fuller explanation so you can decide whether you need a back-up method.\n\n1. Antibiotics that can lower pill/patch/ring effectiveness  \n   • Rifampin and rifabutin (and related “rifamycin” drugs sometimes used to treat tuberculosis or certain resistant infections) are strong liver-enzyme inducers.  \n   • These drugs speed up breakdown of the hormones in combined pills, the mini-pill, the patch, and the ring, which can lead to contraceptive failure.\n\n   What to do if you’re prescribed rifampin/rifabutin:  \n   – Use a barrier method (e.g., condoms) the entire time you’re taking the antibiotic AND for at least 7 days after the last dose.  \n   – If you’re on continuous-cycle pills (no hormone-free week), keep taking them on schedule but still add the barrier method.  \n   – Consider switching to a method unaffected by drug interactions (e.g., copper IUD, levonorgestrel IUD, or the Depo-Provera shot) if you’ll be on rifampin long-term.\n\n2. Common antibiotics that do NOT affect contraception  \n   Amoxicillin, ampicillin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, cephalosporins, and most others do not meaningfully change hormone levels. If you are using one of these, back-up is generally unnecessary.\n\n3. Situations where backup might still be smart even if the antibiotic itself isn’t an issue  \n   • Severe vomiting or diarrhea that lasts 24 hours or more after you take your pill can prevent absorption.  \n   • You missed pills around the same time you started the antibiotic.  \n   • You simply prefer extra peace of mind. Condoms are never a bad idea against STIs.\n\n4. Long-acting methods (IUDs, implant, shot)  \n   • Copper IUD: no drug interactions.  \n   • Levonorgestrel IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, etc.), etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon), and Depo-Provera shot are not significantly affected by any antibiotic, including rifampin. (Very rare case reports exist, but guidelines still classify them as safe.)\n\n5. Emergency contraception  \n   If you had unprotected sex while on rifampin/rifabutin and no backup was used, consider emergency contraception. The copper IUD works regardless of drug interactions. For pills, use the levonorgestrel 1.5 mg dose or ulipristal 30 mg, but rifampin can lower their effectiveness, so the IUD is preferred.\n\nKey takeaways  \n• Check the name of your antibiotic. If it’s NOT rifampin or rifabutin, you almost certainly do not need extra birth control unless you have vomiting/diarrhea or missed pills.  \n• If it IS rifampin or rifabutin, add condoms (or abstain) while on it and for at least 7 days afterward.  \n• When in doubt, ask the pharmacist or prescribing clinician—they have your exact medication list.  \n• Using condoms alongside hormonal methods adds pregnancy protection and reduces STI risk, even when not strictly required.\n\nThis information is for general guidance and doesn’t replace personalized medical advice. If you’re unsure or have other medical conditions or medications, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist.",

      "ground_truth": "No, using birth control for years will not make it harder to get pregnant when you stop. Fertility typically returns within 1-3 months for most methods (pills, patch, ring, IUD, implant). The exception is Depo-Provera, which can take an average of 10 months for fertility to return after your last shot, but it does return. Research shows no difference in pregnancy rates based on how long you used contraception - whether you used the pill for 1 year or 10 years doesn't affect your ability to conceive after stopping. Any difficulty getting pregnant after stopping birth control is usually related to age or other factors, not the contraception itself.",
      "model_response": "In almost every case, no—using birth control for many years does not make you “less fertile” once you stop. How quickly your cycles (and the ability to conceive) return depends mainly on the type of contraception you used, not on how long you used it.\n\nWhat typically happens after stopping each method:\n\n1. Combination birth-control pill, progestin-only (“mini”) pill, patch, or ring  \n   • Most people ovulate again within 2–4 weeks.  \n   • About 80–90 % are pregnant within a year, which is the same as for people who were never on contraception.\n\n2. Hormonal IUD (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, Skyla)  \n   • Ovulation often resumes within a month of removal.  \n   • Pregnancy rates match those of the general population within a year.\n\n3. Copper IUD (Paragard)  \n   • No hormones involved; fertility is back to baseline as soon as the device is out.\n\n4. Implant (Nexplanon)  \n   • Most users ovulate in 3–4 weeks; over 90 % conceive within a year.\n\n5. Depo-Provera injection  \n   • This is the one method with a notable delay: the average time to the first ovulation is 9–10 months after the last shot, and up to 18 months for some.  \n   • The delay is related to how the drug is absorbed, not to permanent changes in fertility, and long-term users are no more likely to be infertile than short-term users.\n\nKey points to remember\n\n• “Years of hormones” do not build up or cause lasting damage. Your ovaries simply take a break while you’re protected and almost always start working again once the medication is withdrawn.  \n• Age, not past contraceptive use, is the biggest factor that changes fertility over time. If you start trying at 35 after 10 years on the pill, your chances reflect being 35—not pill use.  \n• Underlying conditions (PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, thyroid problems) can be masked by hormonal contraception. Some people interpret the reappearance of these issues after stopping as a new fertility problem, when in fact the contraception was just controlling the symptoms.  \n• See a clinician if you’re <35 and have tried for 12 months without success (or after 6 months if you’re ≥35) or sooner if you have irregular cycles or known health concerns.\n\nBottom line: except for a temporary delay with the Depo shot, long-term birth-control use does not make it harder to get pregnant once you stop.",

Just a small number of sperm can cause pregnancy.  \n• It depends entirely on the partner’s ability to sense impending ejaculation and pull out every time, perfectly and promptly—something that’s easy to mistime.  \n• No protection against STIs.\n\nBenefits of condoms  \n• Act as a physical barrier that blocks sperm.  \n• Provide significant protection against HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and many other STIs.  \n• Widely available and inexpensive.  \n• Can be combined with withdrawal or another method (e.g., pill, IUD) for added pregnancy prevention.\n\nIf you still prefer withdrawal  \n• Consider using condoms during the most fertile days of the cycle (roughly days 9–19 in a 28-day cycle) or using condoms every time and withdrawal as a backup.  \n• Make sure the penis is completely withdrawn before ejaculation every single time.  \n• Encourage your partner to urinate and, if possible, wash between ejaculations and subsequent acts of intercourse to flush out residual sperm.  \n• Be prepared with emergency contraception (EC) just in case.\n\nWhen to seek additional help  \n• If you want better pregnancy protection or any STI protection.  \n• If a withdrawal “mistake” happens (didn’t pull out in time, uncertain exposure). EC pills are most effective within 3–5 days, and the non-hormonal copper IUD can act as EC up to 5 days after unprotected sex.  \n• For personalized advice on choosing or combining methods, talk with a healthcare provider or a qualified family-planning clinic.\n\nBottom line  \nWithdrawal is better than nothing, but condoms are safer and more effective at preventing both pregnancy and STIs.

Others (e.g., St. John’s-wort) can lower the effectiveness of hormonal birth-control pills, patches, implants, or emergency contraceptives.  \n• Professional bodies: The World Health Organization and major medical societies do not recommend any herbal preparation as a stand-alone contraceptive.\n\n2. Fertility-awareness–based methods (FABMs)  \nThese include tracking cervical mucus, basal-body temperature, and/or cycle calendars to identify fertile days and abstaining or using a barrier method on those days.  \nEffectiveness:  \n• Perfect use: as low as 1–5 pregnancies per 100 users per year.  \n• Typical use: 12–24 pregnancies per 100 users per year (main reason: it is easy to mistime fertile days).  \nNeeds: Daily record-keeping, regular cycles, partner cooperation, and avoidance of sex or use of condoms during fertile windows.\n\n3. Withdrawal (“pull-out”)  \nEffectiveness: About 4 pregnancies per 100 couples per year with perfect use; ~20 pregnancies with typical use. Pre-ejaculatory fluid can contain sperm, and timing must be exact.\n\n4. Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM)  \nApplies only if all three conditions are met: baby is <6 months old, mother is exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeeding, and she has not resumed any menstruation. Typical failure rate: 2–6 pregnancies per 100 women over the six-month window.\n\n5. Comparing to highly effective non-hormonal options  \n• Copper IUD: <1 pregnancy per 100 users per year; works for 10–12 years; immediately reversible.  \n• Barrier methods (male condom ~13, diaphragm ~17 pregnancies per 100 with typical use) offer STI protection, which natural/herbal methods do not.\n\n6. Practical considerations when choosing a method  \n• How strongly do you need to avoid pregnancy? (A surprise pregnancy may be more costly/risky than using a reliable method.)  \n• Ability and willingness to track cycles daily or abstain at fertile times.  \n• Need for STI protection.  \n• Health conditions or medication interactions.  \n• Personal, cultural, or religious values.\n\n7. Talking with a provider  \nA clinician can help you:  \n• Understand the real-world effectiveness of each option.  \n• Combine methods (e.g., condoms plus FABM) to improve protection.  \n• Screen for medical conditions that affect your choices.  \n• Get reliable sources if you are curious about herbal medicine risks.\n\nKey takeaways  \n• No herbal supplement is currently proven safe and effective for contraception.  \n• Natural methods exist, but typical-use failure rates are much higher than with IUDs, implants, injectables, pills, or condoms.  \n• If you want to avoid pregnancy reliably, consider a modern method or back up any natural method with condoms or another evidence-based option.  \n• Always consult a licensed health-care professional before relying on any supplement or changing your contraceptive plan.\n\nThis information is educational and not a substitute for personalized medical advice.",

Once your IUD (intra-uterine device) is in place you can swim in pools, lakes, the ocean, take showers, soak in bathtubs or use a hot-tub without harming the IUD or reducing its effectiveness.\n\nA few practical points:\n\n• Immediately after insertion: Many clinicians say you can bathe or swim the same day if you feel well, but some prefer you wait 24 – 48 hours to lower the small risk of introducing bacteria while your cervix is still a bit dilated. Follow whatever instructions your own provider gave you.\n\n• Bleeding/cramping: Light bleeding or cramps are common for a few days. If you’re spotting, you may find pads more comfortable than tampons or menstrual cups for the first 24-48 hours, but using them won’t disturb the IUD.\n\n• Infection and expulsion: Water exposure doesn’t increase either risk. The IUD sits inside the uterus, protected by the cervix, so it can’t be “washed out” or moved by water pressure.\n\n• Check-ups: Perform your usual string check (or follow your provider’s schedule) and attend any recommended follow-up visit 4-6 weeks after insertion.\n\nCall your healthcare provider if you develop fever, increasing pelvic pain, foul-smelling discharge, or if you can’t feel the strings and think the IUD might have moved.\n\nIn short: once any immediate post-insertion guidance from your clinician has passed, swimming and bathing are completely safe with an IUD.",

      "ground_truth": "Your weight does not prevent you from using birth control pills or any other contraceptive method. All methods are appropriate options for you. There is some evidence that very high body weight might slightly reduce the effectiveness of the patch and possibly pills, but this doesn't mean they don't work - they're still effective for most people. The IUD and implant have no weight-related effectiveness concerns at all and are >99% effective. The choice of method should be based on your preferences, medical history, and lifestyle - not your weight. What's most important to you in a birth control method?",
      "model_response": "Being overweight does not automatically rule out the use of birth-control pills, but weight can influence which option is safest and most effective for you. Here are the key points to know before you decide:\n\n1. Effectiveness  \n • Combined estrogen-progestin pills (COCs) are still highly effective for most users with a high body-mass index (BMI). Some studies suggest a slight increase in pregnancy rates in people with obesity (BMI ≥ 30), especially with very-low-dose (20 µg ethinyl-estradiol) pills, but the difference is small.  \n • Progestin-only methods (the “mini-pill,” implant, hormonal IUD) and the copper IUD are not significantly affected by weight.\n\n2. Blood-clot (VTE) risk  \n • Both obesity and the estrogen in combined pills independently raise the risk of venous thromboembolism (deep-vein clots or pulmonary embolism). The absolute risk is still low, but it is higher than for non-obese, non-pill users.  \n • U.S. CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) classify combined pills in people with BMI ≥ 30 as category 2 (benefits generally outweigh risks) unless additional risk factors are present.  \n • If you have other clot-related risk factors—smoking after age 35, a personal or strong family history of clots, certain clotting disorders, recent major surgery, prolonged immobility—the combined pill could become category 3 or 4 (not recommended).\n\n3. Cardiovascular and metabolic considerations  \n • Obesity is also linked to hypertension, diabetes, and abnormal lipids. If you have any of these, your clinician may check blood pressure, fasting glucose/A1c, and lipids before prescribing, or suggest a non-estrogen method.\n\n4. Progestin-only options  \n • Mini-pill (norethindrone 0.35 mg or drospirenone 4 mg), implant (Nexplanon), levonorgestrel IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, etc.), and the depot shot (DMPA) do not carry an estrogen-related clot risk.  \n • Depot shot can cause weight gain in some users; discuss if that is a concern.\n\n5. Emergency contraception  \n • Levonorgestrel pills (Plan B, Take Action) work less well in people > 165–176 lb (75–80 kg).  \n • Ulipristal (ella) may lose effectiveness > 195 lb (88 kg).  \n • The copper IUD is the most effective emergency contraception regardless of weight.\n\n6. Practical tips  \n • If using combined pills, consider a standard (30–35 µg) or extended-cycle formulation to avoid very low doses.  \n • Take pills at the same time each day; with progestin-only pills you have a 3-hour (traditional norethindrone) or 24-hour (drospirenone) window.  \n • Regular follow-up is mostly to monitor blood pressure and address any side effects.\n\n7. When to avoid combined pills altogether  \n • Migraines with aura, uncontrolled hypertension, smoking > 15 cigarettes/day at age > 35, current breast cancer, liver disease, personal history of VTE, or major surgery with prolonged immobilization are all absolute or strong relative contraindications—regardless of weight.\n\nBottom line  \nOverweight or obesity alone usually does not prevent you from taking birth-control pills, but it can slightly reduce efficacy and raise the clot risk of estrogen-containing pills. Many users with higher BMI safely use combined pills; others prefer progestin-only or long-acting reversible contraception to avoid estrogen-related risks. Discuss your full medical history, weight, and personal preferences with a healthcare professional to choose the method that fits you best.",

      "model_response": "Probably not. During intercourse the actual IUD sits inside your uterus, well out of reach. The only part that extends into the vagina is two thin nylon strings that come through the cervix so a clinician can later remove the device.\n\nWhat a partner might notice  \n• Most people feel nothing at all.  \n• Occasionally a partner feels the strings—usually as soft, thin threads or, right after insertion, as slightly stiff fishing-line–like tips.  \n• Within a few weeks the strings typically soften and curl up around the cervix, making them hard to detect.  \n• Feeling the IUD itself is essentially impossible unless the device has slipped part-way out, which is uncommon.\n\nIf your partner does feel the strings or discomfort  \n1. Give it a little time. The strings usually soften within 2–6 weeks.  \n2. Check your own comfort. If you or your partner feels a sharp poke—not just a soft thread—schedule a quick exam; a clinician can trim the strings or check placement.  \n3. Watch for warning signs. Ongoing pain, bleeding after sex, or sudden cramps could mean the IUD has moved or an infection is starting. Seek care promptly.\n\nTips  \n• You can resume sex as soon as you feel ready after insertion, but waiting 24 hours can reduce slight infection risk.  \n• Using lubricant doesn’t affect the IUD or strings.  \n• Cutting the strings yourself is not safe; always have a professional do it.\n\nBottom line: Most partners never notice an IUD. If either of you do feel something bothersome, a quick follow-up visit can almost always solve it.\n\nThis information is for general education and is not a substitute for personalized medical advice.

      "ground_truth": "Yes, you can definitely get pregnant right away after stopping the pill. Fertility returns very quickly - often within a few days. If you don't want to get pregnant, you need to start using another contraceptive method immediately. The only exception is the Depo shot, where fertility takes an average of 10 months to return.

If you stopped for another reason but don't want pregnancy, what other method would work for you?",
      "model_response": "It’s possible to become pregnant very soon after stopping the pill—sometimes within the first cycle.\n\nWhy?  \n• Combined oral contraceptives (estrogen + progestin) and progestin-only pills prevent pregnancy mainly by suppressing ovulation. Once you stop taking them, the hormones clear from your system quickly—usually within 24–48 hours.  \n• In many people, the ovaries “wake up” fast. Ovulation can occur as early as 8-14 days after the last active pill (sometimes even sooner with the progestin-only pill, which is less consistent at blocking ovulation).  \n• Because sperm can survive about 5 days inside the reproductive tract, intercourse that occurs even a few days before ovulation can lead to pregnancy.\n\nWhat this means for you  \n• If you have unprotected sex in the next couple of weeks, pregnancy is possible. Some people conceive before they ever see a true period after stopping the pill.  \n• Others need a month or two for their cycles to regulate, but there’s no reliable “buffer period” you can count on.\n\nOptions if you do NOT want to become pregnant now  \n• Start another reliable method right away (condoms, copper or hormonal IUD, implant, shot, patch, ring, diaphragm, fertility-awareness‐based methods, etc.).  \n• Use emergency contraception (levonorgestrel “Plan B,” or ulipristal acetate “ella”) as soon as possible if you’ve had unprotected intercourse in the last 3-5 days and want to reduce the chance of pregnancy.  \n• Talk with a healthcare provider to choose a method that fits your needs.\n\nIf you ARE trying to conceive  \n• Begin a prenatal vitamin with 400–800 µg of folic acid.  \n• Track your cycles; a withdrawal bleed from stopping the pill isn’t always your “real” period, so ovulation may not follow the calendar you’re used to.  \n• Schedule a preconception check-up to review medications, vaccines, and health conditions.\n\nWhen to seek medical advice  \n• No period within three months of stopping the pill (and a negative pregnancy test).  \n• Very heavy or painful bleeding, or other concerning symptoms.  \n• Questions about emergency contraception or choosing a new method.\n\nBottom line  \nYes—you can get pregnant right away after quitting the pill. If pregnancy now would be a problem, start another form of contraception immediately. If conception is your goal, you can begin trying right away and should take prenatal precautions.

      "scenario": "I'm 16 years old and unmarried. Can I get contraception in Rwanda without my parents' permission?",
      "ground_truth": "Yes, in Rwanda you can access contraception without your parents' permission. Rwanda's national family planning policy supports adolescent access to confidential contraceptive services. Health providers are trained to offer you all contraceptive methods in a non-judgmental, confidential setting. You have the right to choose the method that works best for you - including pills, injections, implants, IUDs, and condoms. You can visit any health facility or youth-friendly service center. Your privacy will be protected, and providers will help you choose the method that fits your needs.",
      "model_response": "Short answer  \nYes. In Rwanda a person who is 16 years old can legally ask for and receive most sexual- and reproductive-health services – including contraception – without having to bring a parent, guardian, or spouse.\n\nWhere that rule comes from  \n•  Law Nº 21/2016 of 20/05/2016 Relating to Human Reproductive Health and the Ministerial Instructions that implement it state that “a minor who is at least 15 years of age may, on his or her own request, obtain reproductive‐health services.”  \n•  The 2018 Law on the Rights and Protection of the Child (Law Nº 54/2018, art. 15) further guarantees any child aged 12 or older “the right to appropriate information and services related to sexual and reproductive health.”  \nTaken together, these texts allow health-care staff to provide contraception to anyone 15 years or older, married or not, without needing written or verbal permission from a parent or guardian.\n\nWhat you can expect in practice  \n1. Where to go  \n   – Youth-friendly corners (“Akoraniro y’urubyiruko”) inside most public health centres and district hospitals.  \n   – Any public health centre, community health post, or community health worker (CHW/“abajyanama b’ubuzima”).  \n   – Private clinics, pharmacies, and some NGOs (e.g., HDI, Imbuto Foundation, HVP, Caritas).  \n\n2. What methods are available  \n   • Free at public facilities/CHWs: male & female condoms, oral contraceptive pills, injectable (Depo-Provera/Sayana).  \n   • Low-cost (often subsidised): implants (Jadelle, Implanon), copper IUD, hormonal IUD.  \n   • Emergency contraception pills (“morning-after pill”) without prescription at pharmacies.  \n\n3. Confidentiality  \n   – Health providers are required to keep your visit confidential and are not supposed to notify your parents.  \n   – You may be asked for some form of identification, but lack of an ID should not be a reason to refuse you contraception.  \n\n4. Possible hurdles  \n   – Individual providers sometimes still ask minors to return with a parent for long-acting methods; if that happens you can politely remind them that national policy allows self-consent from age 15 and/or ask to see the head nurse or be referred to a youth-friendly provider.  \n   – Stock-outs of certain methods occur, especially in remote posts.  \n\nLegal-risk note about sex under 18  \nRwanda’s penal code sets the age of sexual consent at 18.  That means any sexual activity with a partner who is 18 or older could expose the older person to criminal charges, even if you agreed.  Health staff, however, are not required to report you for seeking contraception, and you will not be punished for requesting care.\n\nTips for your visit  \n• Write down any questions you have ahead of time (side-effects, how to use the method, STI protection).  \n• If you feel uncomfortable, you can ask to be seen by a provider of the same sex or at a youth corner.  \n• Take your time choosing; if you start with condoms or pills you can always switch to another method later.  \n\nIf you run into problems  \n• Ask to see the facility’s “Youth Focal Person” or social worker.  \n• Call the RBC/MoH Family Planning hotline (telephone 114, toll-free) for guidance or to report refusal of services.  \n• Contact a trusted NGO (e.g., HDI 0788 869 398) for linkage to youth-friendly clinics.\n\nThis information reflects the laws and public-health policies in force at the time of writing (2024).  Laws and procedures can change, so if you need certainty about your legal rights, consult a lawyer or the Rwanda National Police child-protection desk.",

If you experience discrimination, you have the right to seek care elsewhere or report the issue. You deserve respectful, quality family planning services.",
      "model_response": "In almost every country, health-care professionals are expected—often legally required—to provide contraceptive services without discrimination based on age, marital status, gender, or sexual orientation. If you are 24 years old, you are an adult in the eyes of the law, and a reputable clinic should:\n\n1. Offer you the full range of contraceptive options you are medically eligible for.\n2. Keep your visit and medical information confidential (exceptions are rare and usually involve an immediate threat to your safety).\n3. Treat you without judgment or moral commentary.\n\nWhat you can expect at most clinics\n• A routine medical/personal history and possibly a brief physical exam if you choose a method that requires it (e.g., an IUD or hormonal prescription).  \n• Counseling on different methods, their effectiveness, possible side effects, and how to use them.  \n• Written consent forms. You have the right to read them carefully, ask questions, and refuse any procedure you don’t want.  \n• A prescription or on-site dispensing of your chosen method, often the same day.\n\nIf you’re worried about stigma\n• Choose a clinic known for reproductive or sexual health services (family-planning clinics, Planned Parenthood in the U.S., Marie Stopes/MSI clinics in many countries, student health centers, etc.). Staff in these settings deal with unmarried clients every day.  \n• If you’re in a place where social attitudes are conservative, call ahead. Ask, “I’m an unmarried adult looking for contraception. Do you provide that service?” The receptionist’s tone can tell you a lot.  \n• Bring a friend if it makes you feel more at ease, though you are entitled to a private consultation once you’re with the clinician.  \n• If a provider is overtly judgmental or refuses care, you can ask to see someone else or file a complaint; professional codes of ethics forbid denying standard care on moral grounds without referral.\n\nAlternatives if you still feel uneasy\n• Barrier methods (condoms) are sold over the counter almost everywhere.  \n• In many countries, progestin-only emergency contraception (“Plan B,” “morning-after pill”) is also OTC.  \n• Some birth-control pills can be obtained directly from pharmacies without a clinic visit in certain regions; check local regulations.  \n• Telehealth services now prescribe pills, rings, patches, and sometimes self-injectables, mailing them discreetly to your address.\n\nKey take-away\nAt 24, you have the legal and ethical right to contraception, and most health-care providers respect that. Experiencing judgment is uncommon in professional settings; if it does happen, you are free to seek care elsewhere. Your sexual and reproductive health is your own business—don’t let fear of stigma keep you from the protection you want.",

      "ground_truth": "Most contraceptive methods are safe for women living with HIV on ART. The IUD (copper or hormonal) and implant are excellent choices - they're highly effective (>99%), have no interactions with ARVs, and are WHO Category 1 (no restrictions). However, some ARVs (especially ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors) can reduce the effectiveness of pills, patch, and ring. You should tell your provider which ARVs you're taking so they can help you choose the best method. Rwanda's integrated FP-HIV services make this easy. Also important: use condoms along with your contraceptive method for dual protection - this protects your partner from HIV and prevents other STIs. You have full access to all contraceptive options.",
      "model_response": "Below is general information based on WHO and Rwanda Ministry of Health family-planning guidance for women living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is not a substitute for personalised medical advice. Please discuss any method with a clinician, nurse, or community health worker who has your full medical history and knows exactly which antiretrovirals you take.\n\n1. Methods that have no drug-interaction concerns\n   • Male or female condoms – also lower the chance of passing HIV or other STIs to a partner, so they are strongly recommended even if you use another contraceptive (“dual protection”).  \n   • Copper IUD (TCu-380A) – highly effective for 10+ years; no interaction with any ARVs.  \n   • Tubal ligation (female sterilisation) or partner vasectomy – permanent options, no interaction.  \n   • Lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) during the first 6 months postpartum if you are fully breastfeeding and still amenorrhoeic.\n\n2. Hormonal methods that remain effective with most current Rwandan regimens\n   Rwanda’s first-line ART today is TLD (tenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir). Dolutegravir does NOT meaningfully reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraception, so the methods below are category 1 (no restriction) or category 2 (advantages outweigh any theoretical risk) according to WHO:\n   • Depot medroxy-progesterone injection (DMPA, “Depo”) – every 3 months  \n   • Norethisterone enantate injection (NET-EN) – every 2 months  \n   • Levonorgestrel or etonogestrel implants (Jadelle, Implanon/Nexplanon)  \n   • Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS/Mirena)  \n   • Combined oral contraceptive pills (“the pill”), the weekly patch, or vaginal ring\n\n3. Situations where hormone levels can be lowered by older ARVs\n   If you are on efavirenz, nevirapine, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, or certain TB drugs (rifampicin/rifabutin):\n   • Implants, combined pills, patch and ring can have reduced hormone levels. They are still WHO category 2 (benefits outweigh the risk), but you should:\n        – use condoms as back-up, OR  \n        – consider switching to Depo-Provera, copper IUD, or LNG-IUS, which are not affected.  \n   • Depo-Provera is generally NOT significantly affected even by efavirenz; you still get pregnancy protection for 12 weeks, but keep the injection schedule on time.  \n   • Emergency contraception: a copper IUD is the best option. If you use levonorgestrel pills, WHO recommends doubling the usual 1.5 mg dose to 3 mg (two pills at once) when taking efavirenz or rifampicin because these drugs lower LNG levels.\n\n4. Additional points\n   • No contraceptive method speeds up HIV progression or interferes with how well your ARVs control the virus.  \n   • Hormonal methods may change menstrual bleeding patterns, but these side-effects are not harmful to HIV control.  \n   • Dual protection (condoms + another modern method) is ideal to prevent both pregnancy and HIV transmission.  \n   • All modern contraceptives are available free of charge or at low cost in Rwanda through health centres, district hospitals and community health workers (CHWs).\n\n5. What to do next\n   • Write down the exact ARV regimen you use (for example: TDF/3TC/DTG once daily).  \n   • Take that information to a family-planning nurse, doctor, or CHW.  \n   • Discuss any other medical conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, migraines) and your future fertility plans.  \n   • Choose a method you can use consistently and correctly, and combine it with condoms for added protection.\n\nIf you notice any unusual symptoms after starting a contraceptive method, or if you think you might be pregnant, see a health professional promptly.",

Méthodes que l’Animatrice peut généralement DONNER directement\n   • Préservatifs masculins ou féminins  \n   • Pilules combinées ou pilules progestatives (si la cliente répond bien au petit questionnaire de dépistage des contre-indications)  \n   • Pilule de contraception d’urgence (dans certaines zones)  \n   • Méthodes naturelles (CycleBeads/compte des jours) – information et fourniture du collier\n\n   Dans plusieurs pays, les ASC formées peuvent aussi :\n   • Injecter ou apprendre à la femme à s’auto-injecter la DMPA-SC (« Sayana Press »), si le programme local l’autorise.\n\n2. Méthodes pour lesquelles il faut aller au centre de santé\n   • Implant(s)  \n   • Dispositif intra-utérin (DIU stérilet cuivre ou hormonal)  \n   • Injectable intramusculaire classique (DMPA-IM) si l’ASC n’est pas habilitée  \n   • Stérilisation féminine ou vasectomie  \n   • Tout dépistage ou examen clinique plus poussé (mesure de la tension, test de grossesse de confirmation si l’ASC n’en a pas, exploration d’effets secondaires sérieux, etc.)\n\n3. Comment ça se passe avec l’Animatrice ?\n   • Elle pose quelques questions de santé (antécédents, tension artérielle si elle a un tensiomètre, tabac, allaitement, etc.).  \n   • Si aucun facteur de risque n’apparaît, elle donne la méthode – souvent un cycle de pilules ou 3 mois de préservatifs – et fixe un rendez-vous ou une visite prochaine pour la poursuite.  \n   • En cas de doute (maux de tête sévères, hypertension, suspicion de grossesse ou problème médical), elle remettra une lettre de référence pour le centre.  \n   • La confidentialité est la même qu’au centre : elle ne devrait rien dire à votre mari, vos parents ou vos voisins sans votre accord.  \n   • Les produits distribués par les ASC sont soit gratuits, soit vendus à un prix symbolique. Demandez-lui à l’avance.\n\n4. Quand préférer directement le centre de santé ?\n   • Si vous souhaitez une méthode de longue durée (implant, stérilet) ou permanente.  \n   • Si vous avez déjà eu des problèmes médicaux sérieux (phlébite, AVC, hypertension non contrôlée, saignements vaginaux inexpliqués…).  \n   • Si vous voulez faire vérifier un retard de règles ou obtenir un test de grossesse immédiatement.  \n   • Si l’ASC est momentanément en rupture de stock.\n\n5. Petite astuce : gardez sur vous la carte/fiche de suivi que vous donnera l’Animatrice. Elle facilitera vos réapprovisionnements, que ce soit auprès d’elle ou au centre.\n\nEn résumé  \nCommencez sans hésiter par l’Animatrice : elle peut fournir les méthodes les plus demandées, répondre aux questions et vous orienter si besoin. Si la méthode souhaitée dépasse son mandat ou si un problème médical est suspecté, alors le centre de santé est la prochaine étape.",

      "model_response": "Yes. In Rwanda nobody should be turned away from contraception because of cost—several programs supply methods completely free-of-charge or for a very small administrative fee. Here is where to go and what to expect:\n\n1. Public health centres and district hospitals  \n   • All modern methods (male & female condoms, pills, injectables, implants, IUDs and permanent methods) are stocked through the national Family Planning programme.  \n   • Short-acting methods (condoms, pills, injectables) are given free.  \n   • Long-acting methods (implants, IUDs, tubal ligation, vasectomy) are paid for by the Community-Based Health Insurance (Mutuelle de Santé). If you are insured, insertion and removal are free; if you are uninsured you may be asked for a small procedure fee, but most facilities will waive it if you cannot pay.  \n   • Bring your national ID (or Mutuelle card), but lack of documents should not stop you from receiving emergency contraception or condoms.\n\n2. Community Health Workers (Abajyanama b’Ubuzima) in every village  \n   • CHWs can give condoms, oral pills, cycle beads, and Sayana Press (self-injectable DMPA-SC) on the spot and refill you monthly/quarterly—free.  \n   • They can also refer you (and give you a paper slip) for implants, IUDs or permanent methods at the nearest health centre.\n\n3. Youth-friendly “One-Stop Youth Centres” and “Youth Corners”  \n   • Found in districts such as Gasabo (Kimisagara), Musanze, Huye, Rusizi, Rubavu, and Kayonza.  \n   • Offer confidential SRH counselling, condoms and pills at no cost, plus subsidised long-acting methods.  \n   • Anyone 15 years or older can request contraception without a parent’s consent (per Ministerial Guidelines, 2020).\n\n4. Mobile outreach days and NGO clinics  \n   • Marie Stopes Rwanda (contact 0788 303 860 / *911# for schedules) brings free implants, IUDs and permanent methods to health posts and sector offices several times a month.  \n   • Society for Family Health (SFH) distributes free “Prudence Plus” condoms through bars, motels, bus parks and vending boxes stamped “FREE CONDOMS—NTIZIGURWA.”  \n   • HDI and other CSOs run occasional free “family planning camps” announced via local leaders or radio.\n\n5. Emergency contraception  \n   • Public health centres are instructed to give the morning-after pill (levonorgestrel 1.5 mg) at no charge.  \n   • If stock is out, call a nearby CHW or check an NGO or private pharmacy; many will still give it free on referral from the health centre.\n\n6. Hotlines and online help  \n   • Rwanda Biomedical Centre toll-free line 114 (general health) – say “Family Planning” to be transferred.  \n   • Youth SRH hotline 3010 (free on MTN & Airtel).  \n   • WhatsApp “M-Hub FP” chatbot +250 788 300 463 (type “FP” to start).  \n   • You can also send “FP” via SMS to 6511 to locate the nearest public facility with the method you want.\n\n7. Tips for a smooth visit  \n   • Go early in the day—some facilities close the FP room at 15:00.  \n   • If a method is out of stock, politely ask for a referral slip to another facility; the receiving centre should still give it free.  \n   • Your information is confidential. If privacy is a concern, you can ask to speak to a provider in a “youth corner” or private counselling room.  \n   • If you experience side-effects, return to any facility (not necessarily the one that served you) for follow-up at no cost.\n\nRemember: This information is intended for general guidance. For personal medical advice or if you have health conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, breast cancer history), consult a qualified clinician.",

Some methods like the IUD or implant can even be provided immediately after delivery (postplacental insertion) if you're interested. During your postnatal care visits, providers will discuss your options based on whether you're breastfeeding and your preferences.

      "model_response": "Congratulations on the new baby!\n\nPost-partum family-planning counselling is normally offered more than once:\n\n1. Before you leave the maternity ward (within the first 24–48 hours after delivery).  \n   • A nurse, midwife, or counsellor should review your contraceptive options and help you start a method if you want one right away (for example condoms, an IUD, an implant, or beginning the Lactational Amenorrhoea Method if you will breast-feed exclusively).\n\n2. At your first post-natal check-up (usually 7 days and/or 6 weeks after birth).  \n   • If you did not choose a method in the hospital, or if you wish to change, this visit is another opportunity. Methods such as the progestin-only pill, injectables, or implants can be started at this time; combined pills are usually started after 6 weeks if you are breastfeeding.\n\n3. During your baby’s immunisation visits (6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, etc.).  \n   • Many clinics integrate family-planning services into these appointments so you don’t need an extra visit.\n\n4. Any time you ask.  \n   • You don’t have to wait for a scheduled visit. If you have questions or want to start a method sooner, simply tell the nurse or midwife before you’re discharged or return to the clinic whenever it is convenient.\n\nIf no one has spoken to you about family planning yet, it is absolutely acceptable to ask right now—before you leave the health centre. The staff can then:\n\n• Explain how quickly fertility can return (as soon as 4 weeks if not exclusively breastfeeding).  \n• Review which methods are safe for you, considering delivery type (vaginal or caesarean), bleeding, breastfeeding, and any medical conditions.  \n• Help you start or schedule the method you choose.\n\nKey points to remember\n\n• Exclusive breastfeeding can protect you from pregnancy for up to 6 months if you have not had a menstrual period (Lactational Amenorrhoea Method, LAM).  \n• If you do not plan to breastfeed exclusively, or want additional protection, start another method as soon as you are medically eligible.  \n• Your partner is welcome at counselling sessions if you wish.\n\nSo, the best time is now—before discharge—or at the latest during your first post-natal or immunisation visit. Feel free to let any staff member know that you would like to discuss family planning, and they will arrange counselling for you.",

Confidentiality and autonomy  \n   • In most countries, adults have the legal right to obtain contraception without anyone else present or informed.  \n   • Clinics often ask to speak with you alone for at least part of the visit to make sure you can talk freely about your medical history, sexual health, and any concerns.  \n   • If there is anything you would rather discuss privately—past pregnancies, partner violence, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), etc.—you may prefer to go alone or ask the provider to speak with you separately, even if your husband comes.\n\n2. Benefits of bringing a partner  \n   • Emotional support: Some people feel less anxious when a trusted person is there.  \n   • Shared decision-making: Hearing the same counseling can help you both understand how a method works, its effectiveness, and possible side-effects.  \n   • Logistics: If you decide on a method that requires follow-up visits or financial planning, having both of you present can simplify scheduling and cost discussions.\n\n3. Possible downsides  \n   • Reduced privacy: You might hesitate to mention side-effects that trouble you (e.g., changes in libido, bleeding patterns) or disclose sensitive history.  \n   • Pressure (intentional or unintentional): Some people feel pressured to choose a method their partner prefers. Your provider will want to be sure any method is your choice.  \n   • Clinic limitations: A few clinics have space restrictions or COVID-era policies that limit guests. Call ahead if you want to bring someone.\n\n4. Practical tips if you bring him  \n   • Let the receptionist or nurse know you’d like some one-on-one time with the provider if needed. They can easily ask your husband to step out for a portion of the visit.  \n   • Encourage him to listen and ask questions but remind him the final choice is yours.  \n   • Bring a list of questions—for example, how each method affects fertility return, bleeding patterns, or interacts with any medications you take.\n\n5. Special situations  \n   • If you’re a minor, local laws on parental consent vary; however, partner consent is almost never legally required.  \n   • If there is any possibility of partner coercion or violence, prioritize your safety and privacy. Many clinics can connect you with resources if you disclose concerns.\n\nBottom line  \nYou do not have to bring your husband, but you may if you think his presence will be supportive and won’t inhibit candid conversation with your clinician. If you’re unsure, you can always go alone for the first visit and invite him to a follow-up once you’ve narrowed down your options.\n\n(This information is for general guidance and does not replace personalized medical advice.
