      "model_response": "Thank you for asking this important question before starting any new method. I want to give you clear information because this is a significant safety consideration.\n\n## Regarding Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (Pills with Estrogen)\n\n**Migraines with aura are a WHO MEC Category 4** for combined hormonal contraceptives (the pill, patch, or ring containing estrogen). This means these methods are **not recommended** for you due to safety concerns.\n\n### Why this matters:\nMigraines with aura are associated with a small but meaningful increased risk of stroke. Estrogen-containing contraceptives can further elevate this risk. This applies even if your migraines with aura are infrequent.\n\n---\n\n## Safe and Effective Alternatives for You\n\nThe good news is you have several excellent options that are **WHO MEC Category 1 or 2** (safe to use):\n\n| Method | Effectiveness (typical use) | Can help with cramps? |\n|--------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Hormonal IUD** (e.g., Mirena) | >99% | Yes, often reduces bleeding and cramping significantly |\n| **Progestin-only pill** (\"mini-pill\") | 91-93% | May help somewhat |\n| **Implant** (Implanon/Jadelle) | >99% | May help |\n| **Copper IUD** | >99% | No (may increase cramping initially) |\n| **Injection** (Depo-Provera) | 94% | Often reduces or stops periods |\n\n---\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nI'd encourage you to:\n1. **Return to your doctor** and clarify that you experience migraines *with aura* specifically\n2. Ask about the **hormonal IUD** — it's highly effective for contraception AND often significantly helps with painful cramps\n3. Discuss whether your cramps might benefit from other treatments as well\n\n---\n\n**A clarifying question:** When you say \"migraines with aura,\" do you experience visual disturbances (flashing lights, blind spots), numbness/tingling, or difficulty speaking before or during your headaches? This distinction is important for your provider to confirm",

This is usually reversible after stopping.\n- ⚠️ **Return to fertility:** It may take **6-12 months** after stopping before fertility returns\n- ⚠️ **Side effects:** Irregular bleeding (especially first few months), possible weight changes, headaches\n\n### Warning signs to watch for:\nSeek care if you experience severe headaches, heavy bleeding, or signs of depression.\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Think About\n\nTo help you decide, consider:\n- Can you return to a clinic every 3 months for injections?\n- How important is it that your periods stay regular?\n- Are you planning pregnancy in the next 1-2",

Category 4 means the method represents an **unacceptable health risk** and should not be used.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe contraceptive patch contains both estrogen and progestin. Estrogen increases the risk of blood clots, and since you've already experienced DVT, using estrogen-containing methods could significantly raise your risk of:\n- Another DVT\n- Pulmonary embolism (clot traveling to lungs)\n- Other serious clotting events\n\nThis applies regardless of how long ago your DVT occurred or whether you're still on blood thinners.\n\n## Safe Alternatives for You (WHO Category 1 or 2)\n\nYou have several highly effective options that are safe with your history:\n\n| Method | Effectiveness (typical use) | WHO Category with DVT history |\n|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Copper IUD | >99% | Category 1 (no restriction) |\n| Hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena) | >99% | Category 2 (generally safe) |\n| Progestin-only implant | >99% | Category 2 |\n| Progestin-only injectable | 94% | Category 2 |\n| Progestin-only pills | 91% | Category 2 |\n\n## Methods to Avoid (Category 4 for you)\n\n- Combined oral contraceptive pills\n- Contraceptive patch\n- Vaginal ring\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nI'd encourage you to discuss the **copper IUD** or **hormonal IUD** with a healthcare provider.

These hormones:\n- Prevent ovulation (release of an egg)\n- Thicken cervical mucus to block sperm\n- Thin the uterine lining\n\n---\n\n## Correct Use for Best Effectiveness\n\nTo achieve effectiveness closer to perfect use:\n- Insert the ring and leave it in place for **3 weeks (21 days)**\n- Remove for **1 week (7 days)** during which withdrawal bleeding occurs\n- Insert a new ring after the ring-free week\n- Keep the ring stored properly before use\n\n---\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n**The ring may be less effective if:**\n- It's left out of the vagina for more than 3 hours\n- You delay inserting a new ring\n- Certain medications interfere (some for HIV, epilepsy, or TB)\n\n---\n\n## Would You Like More Information?\n\nI'm happy to discuss:\n- Who can safely use the ring (medical eligibility)\n- Side effects and warning signs\n- How it compares to other methods\n- Availability in your area\n\nWhat questions do you have?",

Continuous protection is the goal!\n\n**Backup contraception:**\n- If the IUD is inserted while you're on active pills → **no backup needed**\n- If inserted more than 7 days after stopping pills → use **condoms for 7 days** (for hormonal IUD) or consider if you need emergency contraception\n\n## Before Your IUD Appointment\n\nYour provider will:\n- Review your medical history (using WHO MEC criteria)\n- Discuss which IUD type suits you (hormonal vs. copper)\n- Explain the insertion process and what to expect\n\n## Would You Like More Information About:\n- Differences between hormonal (Mirena/Kyleena) and copper IUDs?\n- What to expect during insertion?\n- Side effects to anticipate?\n\nDo you have any specific concerns about making this switch?",

There's no medical need to \"clear your system\" or wait several cycles.\n\n✅ **If you're NOT ready to get pregnant:** Use another contraceptive method immediately when you stop the pill, as pregnancy can happen very quickly.\n\n## A Note on Irregular Cycles\n\nSome people notice their periods take 1-3 months to become regular again. This is normal and doesn't mean you can't get pregnant during this time.\n\n---\n\n**Is there anything else you'd like to know about fertility, stopping contraception, or planning for pregnancy?**\n\n⚠️ **Note:** For personalized medical advice, please consult a qualified healthcare provider.",

Your friend may have had a difficult experience, but that doesn't mean you will. Many women have easy insertions and are very satisfied with their IUDs.\n\n### What I'd Suggest\n\n1. **Don't decide based on one person's experience** - talk to a healthcare provider about YOUR health and needs\n2. **Ask questions** -",

Forgetting pills is one of the most common challenges with oral contraceptives, and it's great that you're thinking about solutions.\n\n## Understanding the Issue\n\nWith **typical use** (which includes missed pills), the combined oral contraceptive pill is about **91% effective** – meaning about 9 in 100 women become pregnant each year. With **perfect use**, it's over 99% effective. The gap between these numbers often comes down to exactly what you're experiencing.\n\n## Options to Consider\n\n### 1. **Strategies to Improve Pill-Taking**\n- Set a daily phone alarm\n- Link it to a daily habit (brushing teeth, morning coffee)\n- Use a pill reminder app\n- Keep pills somewhere visible\n\n### 2. **Consider a Different Method**\nSince you've tried the pill for a year and consistency remains difficult, you might explore methods that don't require daily action:\n\n| Method | How Often to Think About It | Typical Use Effectiveness |\n|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Hormonal IUD** | Every 5-8 years | >99% |\n| **Copper IUD** | Every 10-12 years | >99% |\n| **Implant** | Every 3-5 years | >99% |\n| **Injectable** | Every 2-3 months | 94% |\n| **Patch** | Weekly | 91% |\n| **Ring** | Monthly | 91% |\n\n## Questions to Reflect On\n\n- How often are you missing pills (weekly? monthly?)\n- Are you satisfied with the pill otherwise (side effects, bleeding pattern)?\n- Would you prefer a method you don't have to think about?\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI'd encourage you to visit a health facility to discuss these options. In Rwanda, family planning services are available at health centers, and a provider can help you find a method that fits your lifestyle better.\n\n**What matters most to you in a contraceptive method?** This can help guide which option might work best for you.",

Here's what the evidence shows:\n\n**According to WHO and extensive research:**\n- Fertility returns **quickly** after IUD removal – often within the first menstrual cycle\n- Studies show women who have used IUDs have the **same pregnancy rates** as women who have never used them, once the IUD is removed\n- This applies to **both types**: the hormonal IUD (like Mirena/Levonorgestrel IUD) and the copper IUD\n\n### Where Did This Myth Come From?\n\nIn the 1970s, one particular IUD design (the Dalkon Shield) was linked to infections due to its flawed design. It was removed from the market decades ago. **Modern IUDs are very different** and have excellent safety records.\n\n### What the Evidence Actually Shows\n\n| After IUD Removal | Fertility Return |\n|---|---|\n| First cycle | Many women can conceive |\n| Within 12 months | Pregnancy rates similar to non-users |\n| Long-term fertility | No negative impact |\n\n### Important to Know\n\nThe IUD is actually one of the **most effective reversible methods** available:\n- Over 99% effective\n- Works for 5-12 years depending on type\n- **Completely reversible** – you can have it removed whenever you choose\n\n### Do You Have Other Questions?\n\nI'm happy to discuss:\n- How IUDs actually work\n- Who can safely use an IUD\n- The insertion process\n- Any other concerns you've heard about\n\nWhat matters most is that you have accurate information to make the choice that's right for **you**.",

I understand there's a lot of concern about this topic, so let me share what the WHO guidelines and research evidence actually tell us.\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**The relationship between hormonal contraceptives and cancer is nuanced—not a simple \"causes cancer\" story.** Some risks are slightly increased, while others are actually *decreased*.\n\n---\n\n## What WHO and Research Evidence Show:\n\n### Slightly Increased Risks:\n- **Breast cancer**: A small increased risk while using pills and for ~10 years after stopping. However, this risk returns to normal after stopping, and breast cancer is rare in the age groups most commonly using pills.\n- **Cervical cancer**: Slightly increased risk with long-term use (5+ years), but this is also linked to HPV exposure. Risk decreases after stopping.\n\n### Protective Effects (Decreased Risk):\n- **Ovarian cancer**: Risk reduced by 30-50%, protection lasts 20+ years after stopping\n- **Endometrial (uterine) cancer**: Risk reduced by about 50%, protection lasts 15+ years\n- **Colorectal cancer**: Some evidence of reduced risk\n\n---\n\n## Putting This in Perspective\n\nThe WHO classifies combined hormonal contraceptives as **Category 1 (no restriction)** for most healthy women because:\n\n- The absolute increase in risk is very small\n- The protective effects against some cancers may balance or outweigh increased risks\n- Overall, pill users do not have higher cancer mortality\n\n---\n\n## When to Discuss Further with a Provider\n\nYou should have a more detailed conversation if you have:\n- Personal history of breast cancer\n- Strong family history of breast cancer (BRCA genes)\n- Current cervical cancer\n- Other individual risk factors\n\n---\n\n## What Would Help You Most?\n\nWould you like to:\n- Discuss your personal health history and risk factors?\n- Learn about non-hormonal contraceptive options?\n- Get more information about any specific cancer type?\n\n**Your concerns are valid, and I'm here to help you make an informed choice that feels right for you.**",

Here's what to know:\n\n**Initially (first few weeks):**\n- The strings may feel slightly firm or \"poky\" to some partners\n- This is usually temporary as the strings soften over time\n\n**After settling (1-3 months):**\n- The strings soften and typically curl around the cervix\n- Most partners report they cannot feel them at all\n- Some may occasionally notice them but find it's not bothersome\n\n### If Your Partner Does Feel the Strings\n\nThis is not harmful, but if it's uncomfortable, options include:\n\n1. **Wait a bit** – strings often soften within the first few months\n2. **Return to your provider** – they can trim the strings shorter\n3. **Check string position** – sometimes strings just need to curl more naturally\n\n> ⚠️ **Important:** If strings suddenly feel much longer, shorter, or you can feel hard plastic, contact your healthcare provider to check IUD placement.\n\n### Reassurance\n\nThe IUD does **not** affect sexual pleasure for you or your partner, and sex will not dislodge a properly placed IUD.\n\nDo you have other questions about IUDs or any concerns about this method?",
