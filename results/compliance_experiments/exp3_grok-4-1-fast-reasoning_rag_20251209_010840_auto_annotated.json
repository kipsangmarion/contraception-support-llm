IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication.

There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low.

For relief, ibuprofen or other NSAIDs can help (WHO_FP_Handbook_2022.pdf, Page 204).\n\nRegarding infections: The IUD does not routinely cause infections, but there is higher risk if you or a partner have STI symptoms (e.g., pus, pain/burning when urinating, sores). In such cases, consider other methods if at very high risk (WHO_FP_Handbook_2022.pdf, Pages 195).

It suggests that the timing for family planning discussions is unspecified, which could lead to delays in receiving necessary information and services. Additionally, it does not consider breastfeeding status in the context of family planning, which is crucial for postpartum care.
