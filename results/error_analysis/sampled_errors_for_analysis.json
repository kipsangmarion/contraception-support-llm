    "scenario": "How effective is spermicide alone?",
    "model_response": "Effectiveness\n\n• Typical-use effectiveness: about 79 % (approximately 21 pregnancies per 100 women during the first year of use).  \n• Correct and consistent (perfect) use every time you have sex: about 85 % (15 – 18 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year).\n\nWhat this means: spermicide used alone prevents some pregnancies, but it is noticeably less reliable than most other modern methods. Many people choose to combine it with condoms or another barrier to improve protection.\n\nHow spermicide works\n• The most common active ingredient is nonoxynol-9, a chemical that inactivates sperm.  \n• It comes as a gel, foam, film, tablet, or suppository that is placed deep in the vagina before every act of intercourse.  \n• Most products need 10–15 minutes to melt/foam and are effective for about 1 hour. A fresh dose is needed for each act of sex, even if it is within the same hour.\n\nWHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC)\n• Category 1 (no restriction) for most women.  \n• Category 4 (unacceptable health risk) for women at high risk of HIV acquisition, because frequent use of nonoxynol-9 can irritate vaginal tissue and may increase HIV risk.  \n• Category 2 for women living with HIV who are clinically well and on ART.  \nIf you are unsure about your HIV risk, talk with a health-care provider first.\n\nAdvantages\n• Can be bought without a prescription in many countries.  \n• Used only when needed; no daily routine.  \n• Gives immediate control to the person who inserts it.  \n• No effect on breastfeeding.  \n• Few systemic (whole-body) side-effects.\n\nPossible side-effects\n• Mild vaginal or penile irritation or burning (usually short-lived).  \n• Allergy (rare). Stop using and seek care if you develop rash or swelling.  \n• Frequent use (more than twice a day) may increase risk of genital lesions or HIV acquisition.\n\nWarning signs – seek care if you notice:\n• Persistent burning, itching, unusual discharge, sores, or rash in the genital area.  \n• Signs of allergy (swelling of lips, tongue, or face; difficulty breathing).  \n• You think you might be pregnant and do not wish to be.\n\nInstructions for correct use\n1. Wash hands.  \n2. Check the expiry date.  \n3. Insert the full dose high into the vagina, close to the cervix.  \n4. Wait the time specified on the package (usually 10–15 minutes).  \n5. Have sex within the product’s effective window (usually ≤1 hour).  \n6. Insert a new dose for every act of intercourse.  \n7. Do not douche or wash the vagina for at least 6 hours afterward.  \n8. For greater protection, consider using a male or female condom as well (dual protection against both pregnancy and STIs, including HIV).\n\nAccess in Rwanda\n• Spermicides are less commonly stocked in public clinics than other methods, but some pharmacies may carry them.  \n• Family-planning services at public facilities are free or low-cost; staff can tell you where to find spermicidal products if you choose them.  \n• Adolescents and all women, married or not, have the right to obtain family-planning methods without needing anyone else’s permission.\n\nKey take-home points\n• Spermicide alone is moderately effective but less reliable than pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, or condoms.  \n• Correct use every single time is essential.  \n• It does not protect against STIs; frequent use can raise HIV risk in women at high exposure risk.  \n• You are free to choose, change, or stop any method whenever you wish. If you would like a more effective option or dual protection, a health-care provider can help you explore all available methods.",
    "ground_truth": "Spermicide used alone is only about 72% effective with typical use, which means about 28 out of 100 women relying solely on spermicide will get pregnant within a year. Even with perfect use, it's only 82% effective. Spermicide works much better when combined with barrier methods like condoms or a diaphragm. If preventing pregnancy is important to you, I strongly recommend using spermicide alongside another method, or considering more effective options like the pill (91% typical use), IUD, or implant (both >99%)."

    "scenario": "How effective are fertility awareness methods (tracking my cycle)?",
    "model_response": "### Effectiveness of Fertility Awareness Methods (FAMs)\n\nFertility awareness methods (FAMs), also called natural family planning or cycle tracking, involve monitoring your menstrual cycle signs—like basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, cervical position, and cycle length—to identify your fertile window (usually 5-7 days per cycle) and avoid unprotected sex or use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) during that time. Common types include the Symptothermal Method (combines multiple signs), Standard Days Method (for cycles 26-32 days), and TwoDay Method (mucus-focused).\n\n#### Key Effectiveness Stats\nEffectiveness varies widely based on **perfect use** (following rules exactly every time) vs. **typical use** (real-world use with occasional mistakes). Data from reliable sources like the CDC, WHO, and studies in *Contraceptive Technology* (20th edition):\n\n| Method Type                  | Perfect Use (Pregnancies per 100 women/year) | Typical Use (Pregnancies per 100 women/year) |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **All FAMs (overall)**      | 0.4–5 (95–99.6% effective)                 | 12–24 (76–88% effective)                   |\n| **Symptothermal**           | 0.4 (99.6% effective)                      | ~2–10 (90–98% effective, with training)    |\n| **Standard Days**           | 5 (95% effective)                          | 12 (88% effective)                         |\n| **TwoDay**                  | 4 (96% effective)                          | 14 (86% effective)                         |\n| **Calendar/Rhythm only**    | 9 (91% effective)                          | 25+ (less reliable)                        |\n\n- **Perfect use** assumes flawless tracking, no sex during fertile days, and consistent daily charting.\n- **Typical use** accounts for human error (e.g., misreading signs, inconsistent tracking, having sex on \"safe\" days that turn fertile).\n\n#### Factors That Affect Effectiveness\n- **High success requires**: Apps/tools (e.g., Natural Cycles, which is FDA-cleared), daily charting, partner cooperation, and 3-6 months of practice to learn your cycle.\n- **Lower effectiveness if**:\n  - Irregular cycles (e.g., PCOS, stress, travel, illness).\n  - Perimenopause, postpartum, breastfeeding, or starting/stopping hormonal birth control.\n  - Alcohol, poor sleep, or illness affecting BBT/mucus.\n  - No backup method during fertile windows.\n- FAMs are **reversible, hormone-free, low-cost**, and have no side effects, but they don't protect against STIs.\n\n#### Comparison to Other Methods\n| Method              | Typical Use Effectiveness |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| FAMs                | 76–88%                   |\n| Condoms             | 87%                      |\n| Pill                | 93%                      |\n| IUD/Implant         | >99%                     |\n\n#### Tips for Success\n1. Use multiple signs (BBT + mucus) for better accuracy.\n2. Track for 3+ cycles before relying on it.\n3. Apps like Clue, Flo, or Natural Cycles can help, but verify claims (Natural Cycles has real-world typical use ~93% with their device).\n4. Combine with barriers for higher protection.\n\n**Important**: FAMs aren't ideal for everyone—talk to a healthcare provider or certified FAM instructor (e.g., via FACTS or Couple to Couple League) for personalized advice, especially if your cycles are irregular. If avoiding pregnancy is critical, consider more reliable options like IUDs. Always confirm with sources like CDC.gov or PlannedParenthood.org for latest data.",
    "ground_truth": "Fertility awareness methods are about 76% effective with typical use, meaning about 24 out of 100 women using these methods will get pregnant within a year. With perfect use (careful tracking, abstinence or barriers during fertile days, regular cycles), effectiveness can reach 95%. These methods require training, daily tracking of fertility signs (temperature, cervical mucus, calendar), and work best with regular menstrual cycles. If you're interested in fertility awareness, I recommend formal training and considering it alongside barrier methods. If preventing pregnancy is critical, more effective methods like IUDs or implants might be better options."

    "scenario": "My vaginal ring fell out 4 hours ago. What should I do?",
    "model_response": "### What to Do If Your Vaginal Ring Fell Out (4 Hours Ago)\n\nDon't panic—4 hours is still manageable, but you need to act quickly since most rings (like NuvaRing) recommend reinsertion or replacement if out for **more than 3 hours**. Here's step-by-step guidance based on standard medical recommendations (e.g., from NuvaRing or Annovera instructions). **Always check your specific ring's leaflet or consult a healthcare provider/pharmacist for personalized advice**, as rules can vary slightly by brand.\n\n#### 1. **Assess the Situation**\n   - **Find the ring**: If you have it, rinse it gently with **cool or lukewarm water only** (no soap, hot water, or chemicals—these can damage it or affect hormone release).\n   - **Timing matters**: What week of your cycle is it in?\n     | Week of Use | Action if Out >3 Hours |\n     |-------------|------------------------|\n     | **Week 1 (Days 1-7)** | Insert a **new ring** right away. Use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) for **7 days**. |\n     | **Week 2 (Days 8-14)** | Reinsert the same ring if intact. Use backup for **7 days** (if it was in place ≥7 days before falling out). |\n     | **Week 3 (Days 15-21)** | Remove it (as scheduled) and insert a **new ring** at the usual time. No backup needed if on schedule. |\n   - If it's your first cycle or you're unsure, treat it like Week 1 (safest approach).\n\n#### 2. **Immediate Steps**\n   - **Reinsert if possible**: If it's Week 2 and clean/intact, fold and insert it now (like putting in a tampon).\n   - **Get a replacement if needed**: Go to a pharmacy for a new ring ASAP—many are available over-the-counter or by prescription.\n   - **Use backup contraception NOW**: Condoms, withdrawal, or abstinence until you've used backup for the required days (usually 7). Avoid relying on the ring alone.\n   - **Emergency contraception?** Consider it (e.g., Plan B/ella) if you've had unprotected sex since it fell out **and** you're in Week 1 or at high pregnancy risk. Take it within 72-120 hours (sooner = better). A provider can advise.\n\n#### 3. **Prevent Future Slip-Outs**\n   - Rings can fall out during sex, bowel movements, tampon use, or strenuous activity.\n   - Insert higher in the vagina (behind pubic bone).\n   - Check daily by gently feeling for it.\n\n#### 4. **When to See a Doctor**\n   - **Today/urgently**: If in Week 1, recent unprotected sex, or any symptoms (pain, unusual discharge, bleeding).\n   - Call your provider, go to a clinic, or use telehealth. They can check hormone levels or pregnancy risk.\n   - Track your cycle in an app for better management.\n\nPregnancy risk is low if you act fast, but backup methods are key. If you share more details (brand, week, recent sex?), I can refine this! Stay safe.",
    "ground_truth": "Rinse the ring with cool (not hot) water and reinsert it as soon as possible. Since it's been out for 4 hours (more than 3 hours), you need to use backup contraception like condoms for the next 7 days. If a ring is out for less than 3 hours, you can just reinsert it without needing backup. Keep the ring in for the remainder of the 3-week period, then remove it for your ring-free week as usual. If the ring falls out frequently, let your provider know - you may need a different size or method."
