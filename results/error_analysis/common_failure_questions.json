        "model_response": "### Effectiveness of Fertility Awareness Methods (FAMs)\n\nFertility awareness methods (FAMs), also called natural family planning or cycle tracking, involve monitoring your menstrual cycle signs—like basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, cervical position, and cycle length—to identify your fertile window (usually 5-7 days per cycle) and avoid unprotected sex or use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) during that time. Common types include the Symptothermal Method (combines multiple signs), Standard Days Method (for cycles 26-32 days), and TwoDay Method (mucus-focused).\n\n#### Key Effectiveness Stats\nEffectiveness varies widely based on **perfect use** (following rules exactly every time) vs. **typical use** (real-world use with occasional mistakes). Data from reliable sources like the CDC, WHO, and studies in *Contraceptive Technology* (20th edition):\n\n| Method Type                  | Perfect Use (Pregnancies per 100 women/year) | Typical Use (Pregnancies per 100 women/year) |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **All FAMs (overall)**      | 0.4–5 (95–99.6% effective)                 | 12–24 (76–88% effective)                   |\n| **Symptothermal**           | 0.4 (99.6% effective)                      | ~2–10 (90–98% effective, with training)    |\n| **Standard Days**           | 5 (95% effective)                          | 12 (88% effective)                         |\n| **TwoDay**                  | 4 (96% effective)                          | 14 (86% effective)                         |\n| **Calendar/Rhythm only**    | 9 (91% effective)                          | 25+ (less reliable)                        |\n\n- **Perfect use** assumes flawless tracking, no sex during fertile days, and consistent daily charting.\n- **Typical use** accounts for human error (e.g., misreading signs, inconsistent tracking, having sex on \"safe\" days that turn fertile).\n\n#### Factors That Affect Effectiveness\n- **High success requires**: Apps/tools (e.g., Natural Cycles, which is FDA-cleared), daily charting, partner cooperation, and 3-6 months of practice to learn your cycle.\n- **Lower effectiveness if**:\n  - Irregular cycles (e.g., PCOS, stress, travel, illness).\n  - Perimenopause, postpartum, breastfeeding, or starting/stopping hormonal birth control.\n  - Alcohol, poor sleep, or illness affecting BBT/mucus.\n  - No backup method during fertile windows.\n- FAMs are **reversible, hormone-free, low-cost**, and have no side effects, but they don't protect against STIs.\n\n#### Comparison to Other Methods\n| Method              | Typical Use Effectiveness |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| FAMs                | 76–88%                   |\n| Condoms             | 87%                      |\n| Pill                | 93%                      |\n| IUD/Implant         | >99%                     |\n\n#### Tips for Success\n1. Use multiple signs (BBT + mucus) for better accuracy.\n2. Track for 3+ cycles before relying on it.\n3. Apps like Clue, Flo, or Natural Cycles can help, but verify claims (Natural Cycles has real-world typical use ~93% with their device).\n4. Combine with barriers for higher protection.\n\n**Important**: FAMs aren't ideal for everyone—talk to a healthcare provider or certified FAM instructor (e.g., via FACTS or Couple to Couple League) for personalized advice, especially if your cycles are irregular. If avoiding pregnancy is critical, consider more reliable options like IUDs. Always confirm with sources like CDC.gov or PlannedParenthood.org for latest data.",

        "model_response": "Fertility-awareness methods (FAMs)—sometimes called “cycle tracking,” “the rhythm method,” or Natural Family Planning—work by identifying the days each cycle when you could become pregnant and then either avoiding intercourse or using a barrier method (such as condoms) on those days.\n\n1. How effective are they?\n   • Perfect (correct and consistent) use: about 95-99% effective, meaning 1–5 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year.  \n   • Typical, real-world use: about 77-88% effective, meaning 12–23 pregnancies per 100 couples in a year.\n\n   The wide range is because there are several ways to track fertility and because effectiveness drops quickly if any step is missed or if a backup method isn’t used during the fertile window.\n\n2. Factors that affect effectiveness\n   • The specific method used:  \n     – Symptothermal (combining temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) is generally the most accurate.  \n     – Standard Days or calendar-only methods are less precise, especially for people with cycle lengths outside 26-32 days.  \n   • Consistency: You must check and record signs daily and either abstain or use a barrier method for about 7–10 days per cycle.  \n   • Cycle regularity: FAMs work best for people whose cycles vary by only a few days month to month.  \n   • Training: Learning from a certified instructor or a reputable program significantly improves success rates.  \n   • Life factors: Illness, stress, travel, breastfeeding, perimenopause, and certain medications can change your fertile signs and make tracking harder.\n\n3. Pros\n   • Non-hormonal, no drug-related side effects.  \n   • Can increase body awareness and partner communication.  \n   • Inexpensive after any initial classes or supplies.\n\n4. Cons\n   • Requires daily commitment and partner cooperation.  \n   • Less forgiving of mistakes than many other methods.  \n   • No protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  \n   • Effectiveness drops if cycles are irregular or if you occasionally skip charting.\n\n5. Tips to maximize effectiveness\n   • Get formal instruction (in person or virtual) for the specific method you choose.  \n   • Combine more than one fertility sign (symptothermal) rather than relying on a calendar alone.  \n   • Keep meticulous daily records—apps can help but should not replace understanding your signs.  \n   • Plan ahead for backup protection or abstinence during the fertile window.  \n   • Re-evaluate after life changes (e.g., postpartum, approaching menopause) when cycles may become less predictable.\n\nBottom line: Fertility-awareness methods can be a good fit for some couples willing to track carefully and avoid unprotected sex during the fertile days, but they generally prevent pregnancy less reliably than IUDs, implants, injectables, pills, rings, or condoms. If you need higher protection or want STI coverage, consider using FAMs with condoms or another barrier method. If you’d like personalized guidance, a health-care provider or certified FAM educator can help you decide whether these methods match your goals and lifestyle.",

        "model_response": "No, health centers will not judge you or refuse to provide contraception simply because you're 24 and unmarried. Here's why, along with some helpful details:\n\n### Why They Won't Refuse or Judge\n- **Age and marital status don't matter**: At 24, you're a legal adult with full rights to make your own healthcare decisions. Contraception is available to anyone who needs it, regardless of relationship status, gender, or lifestyle. There's no legal requirement to be married.\n- **Non-judgmental care**: Reputable health centers (like Planned Parenthood, public health clinics, student health services, or your primary care doctor) are trained to provide confidential, stigma-free services. Staff follow professional ethics and laws like HIPAA (in the US) to protect your privacy—no one shares your info without consent.\n- **Focus on health**: They prioritize your well-being, discussing options based on your medical history, preferences, and needs, not personal judgments.\n\n### What to Expect\n- **Easy access**: Many centers offer same-day appointments, walk-ins, or telehealth. You might need a quick health check (blood pressure, etc.), but no parental consent or spousal approval is required.\n- **Free or low-cost options**: If uninsured, places like Title X clinics (US) provide free or sliding-scale birth control. Check resources like PlannedPlanned.org or your local health department.\n- **Common methods available**:\n  | Method | Effectiveness | Notes |\n  |--------|---------------|-------|\n  | Condoms | 85-98% | Over-the-counter, no prescription. |\n  | Birth control pills | 99% (perfect use) | Prescription, often free samples. |\n  | IUD (e.g., Mirena) | >99% | Long-term (3-12 years), inserted in-clinic. |\n  | Implant (Nexplanon) | >99% | 3-year arm insert. |\n  | Patch/ring/shot | 91-99% | Easy alternatives to pills. |\n\n### Next Steps\n- Search for \"family planning clinic near me\" or visit Bedsider.org for local options and a method matcher tool.\n- Prepare by noting your medical history (allergies, meds) and questions (e.g., side effects, STI testing).\n- If nervous, call ahead anonymously—they're used to these concerns and happy to reassure you.\n\nYou're taking a smart, responsible step for your health. Go ahead and reach out; you'll be treated with respect! If you have more questions about methods or prep, ask away.",

        "model_response": "In almost every country, health-care professionals are expected—often legally required—to provide contraceptive services without discrimination based on age, marital status, gender, or sexual orientation. If you are 24 years old, you are an adult in the eyes of the law, and a reputable clinic should:\n\n1. Offer you the full range of contraceptive options you are medically eligible for.\n2. Keep your visit and medical information confidential (exceptions are rare and usually involve an immediate threat to your safety).\n3. Treat you without judgment or moral commentary.\n\nWhat you can expect at most clinics\n• A routine medical/personal history and possibly a brief physical exam if you choose a method that requires it (e.g., an IUD or hormonal prescription).  \n• Counseling on different methods, their effectiveness, possible side effects, and how to use them.  \n• Written consent forms. You have the right to read them carefully, ask questions, and refuse any procedure you don’t want.  \n• A prescription or on-site dispensing of your chosen method, often the same day.\n\nIf you’re worried about stigma\n• Choose a clinic known for reproductive or sexual health services (family-planning clinics, Planned Parenthood in the U.S., Marie Stopes/MSI clinics in many countries, student health centers, etc.). Staff in these settings deal with unmarried clients every day.  \n• If you’re in a place where social attitudes are conservative, call ahead. Ask, “I’m an unmarried adult looking for contraception. Do you provide that service?” The receptionist’s tone can tell you a lot.  \n• Bring a friend if it makes you feel more at ease, though you are entitled to a private consultation once you’re with the clinician.  \n• If a provider is overtly judgmental or refuses care, you can ask to see someone else or file a complaint; professional codes of ethics forbid denying standard care on moral grounds without referral.\n\nAlternatives if you still feel uneasy\n• Barrier methods (condoms) are sold over the counter almost everywhere.  \n• In many countries, progestin-only emergency contraception (“Plan B,” “morning-after pill”) is also OTC.  \n• Some birth-control pills can be obtained directly from pharmacies without a clinic visit in certain regions; check local regulations.  \n• Telehealth services now prescribe pills, rings, patches, and sometimes self-injectables, mailing them discreetly to your address.\n\nKey take-away\nAt 24, you have the legal and ethical right to contraception, and most health-care providers respect that. Experiencing judgment is uncommon in professional settings; if it does happen, you are free to seek care elsewhere. Your sexual and reproductive health is your own business—don’t let fear of stigma keep you from the protection you want.",

Learning correct use and combining methods can close that gap.\n\nThis information is general health education, not personal medical advice.

Here's step-by-step guidance based on standard medical recommendations (e.g., from NuvaRing or Annovera instructions). **Always check your specific ring's leaflet or consult a healthcare provider/pharmacist for personalized advice**, as rules can vary slightly by brand.\n\n#### 1. **Assess the Situation**\n   - **Find the ring**: If you have it, rinse it gently with **cool or lukewarm water only** (no soap, hot water, or chemicals—these can damage it or affect hormone release).\n   - **Timing matters**: What week of your cycle is it in?\n     | Week of Use | Action if Out >3 Hours |\n     |-------------|------------------------|\n     | **Week 1 (Days 1-7)** | Insert a **new ring** right away. Use backup contraception (e.g., condoms) for **7 days**. |\n     | **Week 2 (Days 8-14)** | Reinsert the same ring if intact. Use backup for **7 days** (if it was in place ≥7 days before falling out). |\n     | **Week 3 (Days 15-21)** | Remove it (as scheduled) and insert a **new ring** at the usual time. No backup needed if on schedule. |\n   - If it's your first cycle or you're unsure, treat it like Week 1 (safest approach).\n\n#### 2. **Immediate Steps**\n   - **Reinsert if possible**: If it's Week 2 and clean/intact, fold and insert it now (like putting in a tampon).\n   - **Get a replacement if needed**: Go to a pharmacy for a new ring ASAP—many are available over-the-counter or by prescription.\n   - **Use backup contraception NOW**: Condoms, withdrawal, or abstinence until you've used backup for the required days (usually 7). Avoid relying on the ring alone.\n   - **Emergency contraception?** Consider it (e.g., Plan B/ella) if you've had unprotected sex since it fell out **and** you're in Week 1 or at high pregnancy risk. Take it within 72-120 hours (sooner = better). A provider can advise.\n\n#### 3. **Prevent Future Slip-Outs**\n   - Rings can fall out during sex, bowel movements, tampon use, or strenuous activity.\n   - Insert higher in the vagina (behind pubic bone).\n   - Check daily by gently feeling for it.\n\n#### 4. **When to See a Doctor**\n   - **Today/urgently**: If in Week 1, recent unprotected sex, or any symptoms (pain, unusual discharge, bleeding).\n   - Call your provider, go to a clinic, or use telehealth. They can check hormone levels or pregnancy risk.\n   - Track your cycle in an app for better management.\n\nPregnancy risk is low if you act fast, but backup methods are key.

        "model_response": "No, withdrawal (also called the pull-out method) is not as effective as condoms for preventing pregnancy, and it offers no protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like condoms do. Here's a clear breakdown based on data from sources like the CDC and Planned Parenthood:\n\n### Effectiveness Comparison (per year of typical use among 100 couples):\n| Method          | Typical Use Success Rate | Pregnancy Risk |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Withdrawal** | 78%                      | 22 pregnancies |\n| **Male Condoms**| 87%                      | 13 pregnancies |\n\n- **Perfect use** (done exactly right every time): Withdrawal is about 96% effective (4% failure), condoms ~98% (2% failure). But \"perfect use\" is hard—withdrawal requires precise timing, and pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) can contain sperm in up to 40% of men.\n- **Typical use** accounts for real-world slip-ups, like not pulling out in time due to excitement or alcohol.\n\n### Other Key Differences:\n- **STI Protection**: Condoms (when used correctly) reduce HIV risk by ~80-90% and many other STIs. Withdrawal offers **zero** protection.\n- **Pros of Withdrawal**: Free, no hormones or devices, spontaneous.\n- **Cons**: High failure rate, stressful, no STI barrier.\n\nFor better protection, consider:\n- **Combining methods**: Withdrawal + condoms boosts effectiveness.\n- **More reliable options**: Hormonal birth control (pill, IUD, implant: 91-99% typical use), female condoms, or sterilization.\n- Track your cycle with apps like Natural Cycles (FDA-cleared, but still ~93% typical use).\n\nTalk to a doctor or clinic (e.g., Planned Parenthood) for personalized advice, free testing, or emergency contraception if needed.

Both methods can prevent pregnancy, but condoms are significantly more effective—and they also reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which withdrawal does not.\n\nEffectiveness at preventing pregnancy  \n(Percentages shown are the average chance of pregnancy in the first year of use for 100 couples.)\n\n• Withdrawal  \n  – Typical use: about 20–27 pregnancies per 100 couples (≈73–80 % effective).  \n  – Perfect use: about 4 pregnancies per 100 couples (≈96 % effective).\n\n• External (“male”) condoms  \n  – Typical use: about 13 pregnancies per 100 couples (≈87 % effective).  \n  – Perfect use: about 2 pregnancies per 100 couples (≈98 % effective).\n\nWhy withdrawal is less reliable  \n• Pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) can pick up sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation. Just a small number of sperm can cause pregnancy.  \n• It depends entirely on the partner’s ability to sense impending ejaculation and pull out every time, perfectly and promptly—something that’s easy to mistime.  \n• No protection against STIs.\n\nBenefits of condoms  \n• Act as a physical barrier that blocks sperm.  \n• Provide significant protection against HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and many other STIs.  \n• Widely available and inexpensive.  \n• Can be combined with withdrawal or another method (e.g., pill, IUD) for added pregnancy prevention.\n\nIf you still prefer withdrawal  \n• Consider using condoms during the most fertile days of the cycle (roughly days 9–19 in a 28-day cycle) or using condoms every time and withdrawal as a backup.  \n• Make sure the penis is completely withdrawn before ejaculation every single time.  \n• Encourage your partner to urinate and, if possible, wash between ejaculations and subsequent acts of intercourse to flush out residual sperm.  \n• Be prepared with emergency contraception (EC) just in case.\n\nWhen to seek additional help  \n• If you want better pregnancy protection or any STI protection.  \n• If a withdrawal “mistake” happens (didn’t pull out in time, uncertain exposure). EC pills are most effective within 3–5 days, and the non-hormonal copper IUD can act as EC up to 5 days after unprotected sex.  \n• For personalized advice on choosing or combining methods, talk with a healthcare provider or a qualified family-planning clinic.\n\nBottom line  \nWithdrawal is better than nothing, but condoms are safer and more effective at preventing both pregnancy and STIs. Using the two methods together—or switching to a long-acting reversible contraceptive—offers even stronger protection.",

Effectiveness can vary slightly by IUD type and individual factors.\n\nOther considerations:\n- **Side effects**: Copper IUD may cause heavier periods and cramping; hormonal IUD often lightens or stops periods but may cause irregular spotting initially, acne, or breast tenderness.\n- **Warning signs** (for both): Severe pain, heavy bleeding, fever, foul discharge, or missed periods—seek care immediately.\n- Both are safe for most people (WHO MEC category 1 or 2 for eligible individuals); a provider checks eligibility.\n\nThe best choice depends on your health, preferences, and menstrual needs.

You might also consider:\n• Expected bleeding changes (the hormonal IUD usually lightens—or may stop—menstrual bleeding, while the copper IUD can cause heavier or longer bleeding for some people, especially in the first months).  \n• Hormonal vs. non-hormonal preference.  \n• Duration of protection (hormonal IUD 3–8 years depending on brand; copper IUD up to 12 years).  \n• Medical conditions (most users are MEC 1 or 2 for either IUD, but a provider will screen for any category 3 or 4 conditions).  \n• Availability and cost: in Rwanda, both methods are offered free or at low cost in public facilities.\n\nIf you’d like to explore which option fits your needs, a trained provider can review your health history, explain insertion and removal, discuss possible side-effects and warning signs, and answer any other questions you may have.",

Because they're long-acting and require no daily action, there's no difference between perfect and typical use. Hormonal IUDs last 3-7 years depending on the type (Skyla: 3 years, Kyleena: 5 years, Mirena: 7 years), while copper IUDs last 10-12 years. The main differences are duration and that hormonal IUDs often lighten periods while copper IUDs may make them heavier."

Use a backup method (like condoms or abstinence) during those first 7 days.\n\n### Key Facts on Effectiveness\n- **Perfect use**: >99% effective (prevents pregnancy in more than 99 out of 100 people in a year).\n- **Typical use**: >99% effective (same as perfect use, as it's long-acting and doesn't rely on daily action).\n\nThe implant lasts 3–5 years depending on the type (confirm with your provider). Common side effects include changes in bleeding patterns (lighter, heavier, irregular, or no periods), headaches, acne, or breast tenderness. **Warning signs to seek care immediately**: severe pain at insertion site, signs of infection (fever, pus), heavy bleeding, chest pain, leg swelling, or severe headaches—go to a health facility right away.\n\nThis is general guidance based on the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook. Your provider will confirm the best timing based on your health and cycle.

        "model_response": "Here is the evidence-based answer from the WHO Family Planning Handbook (2022) and WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC):\n\n1. Immediate protection in certain situations  \n   • If the implant is inserted within the first 7 days of normal menstrual bleeding (Day 1 = first day of bleeding), it prevents pregnancy right away—no back-up method is needed.  \n   • If it is inserted within 21 days after giving birth, whether you are breastfeeding or not, it is also effective immediately.  \n   • If it is inserted immediately after a first-trimester abortion (within 7 days), protection is immediate.\n\n2. When a back-up method is needed  \n   • If the implant is inserted at any other time in the menstrual cycle, or more than 21 days postpartum, you should use a condom or abstain from sex for the next 7 full days. After those 7 days it will be fully effective.  \n   • The same 7-day back-up is advised if the implant is placed more than 7 days after an abortion or miscarriage.\n\nKey points to remember  \n• The implant releases hormone as soon as it is in place; the 7-day window is to be sure ovulation is suppressed.  \n• Typical-use effectiveness: about 0.1 % risk of pregnancy in the first year (over 99 % effective). Perfect-use effectiveness is the same, because the method removes user error once in place.  \n• You can have it removed any time you want; fertility returns quickly.  \n• Common side-effects: changes in bleeding (spotting, lighter or no periods, or sometimes prolonged bleeding), breast tenderness, or mild headaches in the first months.  \n• Warning signs—see a health-care provider immediately if you have: severe lower-abdominal pain, very heavy bleeding, signs of infection at the insertion site (redness, heat, pus), or think you might be pregnant.  \n• In Rwanda, implants are available free or at low cost in public facilities, and adolescents and unmarried women can obtain them without parental or partner consent.\n\nIf anything is unclear or you have additional medical conditions, please consult a qualified health-care provider.",

I'll include effectiveness rates (perfect use vs. typical use), common side effects, and warning signs. The best choice depends on your health, preferences, and lifestyle—talk to a provider for personalized advice using WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC).\n\n### Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) – Highly discreet, last years\nThese are inserted by a provider and you don't need to think about them daily.\n\n- **Implant (e.g., Jadelle or Implanon NXT, 3-5 years)**  \n  Effectiveness: >99% (perfect and typical use).  \n  Pros: Very effective, private (small arm implant, often not visible), reversible.  \n  Common side effects: Irregular bleeding, headaches, acne (usually improve over time).  \n  Warning signs (seek care immediately): Severe pain/swelling at insertion site, heavy bleeding, signs of infection (fever, pus).  \n  MEC for healthy adolescents: Category 1 (no restrictions).\n\n- **Intrauterine Device (IUD, e.g., copper or LNG-IUD like Mirena, 5-10+ years)**  \n  Effectiveness: >99% (perfect), 99-100% (typical).  \n  Pros: Long-term, private once inserted.  \n  Common side effects: Cramping first few months, heavier periods (copper) or lighter (hormonal).  \n  Warning signs: Severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding soaking >2 pads/hour, fever, foul discharge.  \n  MEC for healthy adolescents: Category 1-2 (check for anemia or infections).\n\n### Injectables – Discreet visits every 3 months\n- **Depo-Provera (DMPA) injection**  \n  Effectiveness: 99% perfect use, 94% typical use.  \n  Pros: No daily action, private clinic visits.  \n  Common side effects: Irregular bleeding, weight gain, mood changes (may improve).  \n  Warning signs: Severe headache/vision changes, leg pain/swelling (blood clot risk), jaundice.  \n  MEC for healthy adolescents: Category 1.\n\n### Other Options\n- **Monthly pill or patch**: Effectiveness 99% perfect, 91% typical. Discreet if hidden, but daily/weekly routine might be noticed.  \n- **Condoms (male/female)**: 98% perfect, 82% typical. Available over-the-counter at pharmacies—no provider needed, fully private.\n\nAll methods have return to fertility after stopping (quick for most). No method protects against STIs—use condoms for that.\n\n**Next steps**: Visit a nearby health center (find one via 114 or Rwanda Biomedical Center app). They'll counsel you confidentially, check eligibility, and provide what suits you.

        "model_response": "I hear that you would like reliable pregnancy prevention but do not want your parents to know. Let’s go through your choices in a confidential, non-judgmental way so you can decide what works best for you. Everything below is based on the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+) and, in case you are in Rwanda, the 2021 National FP Policy (which allows adolescents to obtain family-planning services without parental consent and at low or no cost in public facilities).\n\n1. How private can services be?\n• Health-care workers are required to keep your visit confidential. You may attend alone or with someone you trust.  \n• In Rwanda, you can receive any modern contraceptive method (including implants and IUDs) without showing an ID, without a guardian, and free or at minimal cost in public facilities.  \n• You can ask the provider to note only the minimum information in your file and to avoid calling or texting you if you prefer.\n\n2. Discreet methods you control\nBelow are methods that leave little or no evidence at home once provided. All are WHO MEC category 1 for healthy adolescents.\n\nA. Hormonal implant (e.g. Jadelle, Implanon)\n   • What it is: 1–2 small rods placed under the skin of the upper arm; lasts 3–5 years.  \n   • Effectiveness: <1 pregnancy per 100 users in the first year (typical and perfect use ≃ 0.1%).  \n   • Privacy: Totally hidden; only a small bump that you can feel. No supplies to store.  \n   • Common side-effects: Irregular bleeding or no periods, mild headache, breast tenderness.  \n   • Warning signs (rare): Heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, pus/redness at insertion site—seek care.  \n   • Removal: Can be taken out at any time if you change your mind; fertility returns quickly.\n\nB. Intrauterine device (IUD)\n   1. Copper T 380A (non-hormonal, 10+ years)  \n   2. LNG-IUS (hormonal, 5 years)  \n   • Effectiveness: 0.8% (Copper) or 0.2% (LNG-IUS) typical use.  \n   • Privacy: Nothing to see externally; only you and the provider know.  \n   • Side-effects: Copper—heavier periods in first months; LNG-IUS—lighter or no periods.  \n   • Warning signs: Pelvic pain, fever, foul discharge, missed period with pregnancy symptoms—seek care.  \n   • Needs pelvic insertion by a trained provider; you can ask for a female provider if that is more comfortable.\n\nC. Injectable contraceptive (e.g. Depo-Provera, Sayana Press)\n   • Given every 3 months (DMPA) or every 2 months (NET-EN).  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use ≈ 4 pregnancies/100 women per year; correct-time injections ≈ 0.2%.  \n   • Privacy: No supplies at home; a brief clinic visit or self-injection option (Sayana Press) that you can keep privately.  \n   • Side-effects: Irregular bleeding or no periods, weight change, delayed return of fertility (4–10 months on average).  \n   • Warning signs: Severe headaches, heavy bleeding, swelling/redness where injected—seek care.\n\nD. Progestin-only pills (POPs) or combined oral pills (COCs)\n   • Taken daily at the same time.  \n   • Effectiveness: Typical use 7 pregnancies/100 women per year; perfect use ≈ 0.3%.  \n   • Privacy: Packets may be found; you decide if that is acceptable.  \n   • Side-effects: Nausea (often improves), spotting, breast tenderness.  \n   • Warning signs: Severe chest pain, migraines with aura, leg swelling (mostly COCs).  \n   • If living with parents, think about hiding/storing the packet and silent phone reminders.\n\nE. Emergency contraception (EC)\n   • 1.5 mg levonorgestrel pill(s) within 120 hours of unprotected sex; sooner is better.  \n   • Prevents 52–95 % of expected pregnancies depending on timing.  \n   • Does not affect ongoing fertility; can be used more than once, but is not a regular method.  \n   • Available over the counter in many countries; keep receipt and packaging private if needed.\n\nF. Condoms (male or female)\n   • Effectiveness: Male—typical 13%, perfect 2%; Female—typical 21%, perfect 5%.  \n   • Added benefit of STI/HIV prevention.  \n   • Packets are visible, but you can carry a few discreetly.  \n   • Side-effects: None, unless latex allergy (latex-free versions exist).  \n\n3. How to choose?\n• Think about what matters most: privacy, how often you want to think about contraception, menstrual changes, and protection from STIs/HIV.  \n• Many people combine methods (e.g., implant + condom) for extra protection and STI prevention.  \n• You have the right to start, switch, or stop any method at any time.\n\n4. Practical tips for keeping contraceptive use private\n• Schedule clinic visits during school breaks or times your parents expect you to be elsewhere.  \n• Ask the clinic not to stamp your health booklet with the method name, or to write acronyms only.  \n• For injectables or implants, wear clothing that covers the upper arm on the day of insertion.  \n• Store pills or condoms in a private pouch, phone case, or trusted friend’s place if needed.  \n• Use a phone app with a neutral icon or set silent alarms for reminders.  \n\n5. When to return to the clinic or seek care urgently\n• Any severe abdominal or pelvic pain, heavy or prolonged bleeding, fever with pelvic pain, or if you suspect pregnancy.  \n• For hormonal methods: sudden severe headache, chest pain, trouble breathing, leg pain.  \n• If a condom breaks, consider EC within 5 days.\n\n6. Next steps\nIf you feel ready, visit a nearby health center, youth corner, pharmacy, or community health worker. You can simply say you want family-planning services; no one should require your parents’ approval. The provider will review your medical history to confirm eligibility (MEC category) and will help you start the method you choose.\n\nRemember, you are in control of your reproductive health. If you have further questions or concerns, feel free to ask or speak confidentially with a trained health-care provider.",
        "ground_truth": "Your privacy is important. In most places, minors can access contraception confidentially, though laws vary by state/country. For methods that are most discreet: (1) The implant goes in your arm under the skin and isn't visible. (2) An IUD is inside your uterus and can't be seen or felt. (3) The Depo shot is given every 12 weeks with no supplies at home. Pills, patches, and rings are harder to keep private. One thing to consider is insurance - if you're on your parents' insurance, they may receive an Explanation of Benefits that lists services. Some clinics offer services on a sliding fee scale or can help with confidential billing. Would you like information about confidential clinics in your area?"

Warning signs: missed period, unusual discharge, pain—return for care.\n\nIt's great you're thinking about this! Both methods are valid choices—what's most important is what works best for you and your partner.

        "model_response": "Thank you for sharing how you and your partner are currently preventing pregnancy. I can give you some facts so you can decide whether you are satisfied with withdrawal or would like to consider another or an additional method.\n\n1. Effectiveness for preventing pregnancy  \n   (first-year pregnancy rates per 100 couples)  \n   • Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)  \n     – Typical (average) use: about 20 pregnancies (80 % effective)  \n     – Perfect use (always pulling out on time, every time): about 4 pregnancies (96 % effective)  \n   • Male condoms  \n     – Typical use: about 13 pregnancies (87 % effective)  \n     – Perfect use: about 2 pregnancies (98 % effective)\n\n   So with average use, condoms prevent more pregnancies than withdrawal. With perfect use the difference is smaller, but condoms still protect a little better.\n\n2. Protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV  \n   • Male condoms are the only male-controlled method that offer good dual protection—both pregnancy prevention and reduction of STI/HIV risk when used correctly every time you have sex.  \n   • Withdrawal does not protect against STIs because pre-ejaculate fluid can carry sperm as well as HIV or other STIs.\n\n3. Medical eligibility (WHO MEC)  \n   • Both withdrawal and condoms are MEC Category 1 for all users—meaning they are safe for everyone, including adolescents, women who are breastfeeding, and those with medical conditions.  \n   • People with severe latex allergy can use non-latex (polyurethane or polyisoprene) condoms.\n\n4. Cost and availability in Rwanda  \n   • Male condoms are usually available free of charge at public health facilities, youth corners, pharmacies, community health workers, and many shops.  \n   • Withdrawal has no direct cost but generally higher pregnancy risk.\n\n5. Advantages and possible disadvantages  \n   Withdrawal  \n   • Free, immediately available, no devices or hormones.  \n   • No side-effects.  \n   • Requires the male partner to be able to pull out every time before ejaculation; some men find this difficult.  \n   • No STI protection.  \n   • Requires cooperation and trust each time.  \n\n   Male condoms  \n   • Protect against both pregnancy and STIs/HIV.  \n   • Widely available, inexpensive or free.  \n   • Can be used on demand, only when you have sex.  \n   • May reduce sensation for some partners; this can sometimes be improved with adequate lubrication.  \n   • Rare latex allergy in either partner; switching to non-latex condoms can solve this.\n\n6. Improving effectiveness if you continue withdrawal  \n   • Practice good communication and be sure your partner pulls out well before ejaculation every time.  \n   • Consider combining withdrawal with another method such as condoms, fertility-awareness-based methods (e.g., avoiding sex or using condoms on fertile days) or emergency contraception when withdrawal fails.  \n   • Emergency contraceptive pills are more effective the sooner they are taken after unprotected intercourse (up to 120 hours).\n\n7. Warning signs / when to seek care  \n   • If a condom breaks, slips off, or you suspect semen entered the vagina (including if withdrawal was late), you can use emergency contraception and/or seek STI testing.  \n   • For any symptoms of STI (unusual discharge, sores, pain), both partners should be evaluated and treated promptly.\n\n8. Next steps—your choice  \n   • You might decide that withdrawal meets your needs now.  \n   • You might add condoms for better pregnancy prevention and STI protection.  \n   • You might explore other highly effective methods (implants, IUDs, injectables, pills, etc.)—all are available in Rwanda without parental consent for adolescents and at low or no cost at public facilities.  \n\nWould you like more details on how to use condoms correctly, information on other contraceptive options, or help finding a nearby facility or community health worker?",

(WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 88 & 118).\n\nPoints to consider  \n• Effectiveness: One injection prevents pregnancy for about 3 months.  \n• Schedule: Each reinjection should be planned 13 weeks after the last one. If pregnancy cannot be ruled out at the first visit, the shot can still be given, but you will need a back-up method (such as condoms) for the next 7 days. (p. 118).  \n• Side-effects: Young women can be less tolerant of side-effects than older women (p. 353). It is helpful to discuss possible changes in bleeding patterns, weight, or other effects so you know what to expect.  \n• Privacy and convenience: Many adolescents like the shot because it is private and only needed four times a year.  \n• Other options: Every method—pills, implants, IUDs, condoms, etc.—is also considered safe for young people. Comparing methods can help you pick what feels best.\n\nNext steps  \n• Talk with a trained health-care provider.

This is usually not a major concern for short-term use (under 2 years), and bone density typically returns to normal after stopping. Other methods like the implant or IUD are also very effective and don't have this concern. You might also consider pills or the ring. Would you like to discuss the pros and cons of these options to see which best fits your needs?"

However, since the guidance explicitly states that women with a history of DVT should not use monthly injectables (which contain hormones), and the patch follows similar eligibility criteria to other combined hormonal methods, **this raises a significant concern**.\n\n## My Recommendation\n\n**I cannot give you a definitive answer from this context alone**, but your history of DVT is an important medical consideration that requires evaluation by a healthcare provider. Combined hormonal methods (which include the patch) may carry risks for individuals with a history of blood clots.\n\n**Please consult with a healthcare provider** who can:\n- Review your complete medical history\n- Assess your current health status\n- Discuss safer contraceptive options that may be appropriate for you\n\nThere are non-hormonal and progestin-only methods that may be suitable alternatives, which a provider can discuss with you.",

Safe and effective alternatives include progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, the hormonal IUD (which has only local hormones), or the copper IUD. All of these are highly effective and won't increase your blood clot risk."

If the couple avoids vaginal sex, or uses condoms or a diaphragm during the woman’s fertile time, fertility awareness methods can be effective.” (WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 337)\n\n• At the same time, fertility awareness methods are listed among “the least effective methods,” especially for young women whose cycles are still irregular; they should therefore “be used with caution.” (WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 354)\n\nKey points to keep in mind\n1. Correct, consistent use is essential. Couples must be well-trained in the chosen method and highly motivated to avoid unprotected sex on fertile days (WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 337).\n2. Effectiveness drops if you have sex without protection during fertile days or if cycles are irregular (WHO FP Handbook 2022, pp. 337, 354).\n3. Compared with other modern methods (implants, injectables, IUDs, pills, etc.), fertility awareness methods generally prevent fewer pregnancies over a year of typical use (WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 354).\n\nIf you are interested in these methods, consider getting thorough instruction and discuss whether they fit your lifestyle and cycle pattern. If you need more personalised guidance, a healthcare provider or trained fertility-awareness counsellor can help you choose and learn the method that suits you best.",
        "ground_truth": "Fertility awareness methods are about 76% effective with typical use, meaning about 24 out of 100 women using these methods will get pregnant within a year. With perfect use (careful tracking, abstinence or barriers during fertile days, regular cycles), effectiveness can reach 95%. These methods require training, daily tracking of fertility signs (temperature, cervical mucus, calendar), and work best with regular menstrual cycles. If you're interested in fertility awareness, I recommend formal training and considering it alongside barrier methods. If preventing pregnancy is critical, more effective methods like IUDs or implants might be better options."

Studies suggest that diaphragm users have **higher pregnancy rates when they do not use spermicides** (Source 5, Page 319).\n\n- **Proper fitting is essential:** The diaphragm must be properly fitted by a trained provider, and the user should learn to use it correctly. A properly fitted diaphragm should feel comfortable and secure (Sources 2-3, Page 312).\n\n- **Additional benefits:** Some research suggests the diaphragm may help protect against certain cervical infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia, and possibly pelvic inflammatory disease (Source 4, Page 319).\n\n**What I cannot tell you from this context:**\n\nThe specific pregnancy rates or percentage effectiveness figures are not included in the provided sources.\n\n---\n\n**My recommendation:** For complete information about diaphragm effectiveness rates compared to other methods, I encourage you to speak with a healthcare provider or family planning counselor.

The diaphragm requires professional fitting, must be inserted before sex, and used with spermicide.

Your age (25 years) does not, by itself, limit your options. “Age alone does not restrict a woman from using any contraceptive method.” (WHO Family Planning Handbook 2022, p. 357).\n\n2. Available methods include:\n   • Combined hormonal methods (daily pills, monthly injectables, patch, vaginal ring) – WHO lists these among the options to consider (p. 357).  \n   • Progestin-only injectables – they can be started like other methods, and a temporary back-up (for example condoms, spermicides, withdrawal or abstinence) can be used if advised (WHO Handbook 2022, p. 98).  \n   • Barrier or coital-dependent methods such as male/female condoms, spermicides and withdrawal. The Handbook notes that “spermicides and withdrawal are the least effective contraceptive methods” (p. 98).\n\n3. Effectiveness differs. Long-acting or hormonal methods are generally more effective at preventing pregnancy than spermicides or withdrawal (WHO Handbook 2022, p. 98).\n\n4. Choosing a method\n   • Think about how often you want to remember the method (every day, every month, every few months, only at the time you have sex).  \n   • Consider convenience, possible side-effects, and personal preferences.  \n   • Backup protection is sometimes recommended when you first start a method (WHO Handbook 2022, p. 98).\n\nNext steps\nBecause selecting contraception is personal, you may wish to visit a health-care provider or family-planning clinic. They can review your health history, explain each option in detail, and help you decide what fits your needs and lifestyle.\n\nIf you have questions that were not covered here, a provider can give you more comprehensive information.",

        "model_response": "Thank you for sharing your concerns. It's completely understandable to have questions when you hear things from friends. Let me share what the guidelines say so you can make an informed decision.\n\n## What the Guidelines Say:\n\n**Regarding infections:**\nThe context indicates that IUDs are generally safe, but healthcare providers do take precautions. According to the WHO Family Planning Handbook:\n\n- If someone is at **very high individual risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)**, providers may discuss other method options or take additional precautions\n- If a pelvic infection does occur while using an IUD, it can be treated with antibiotics, and \"there is no need to remove the IUD\" if the woman wants to continue using it (Source 4)\n\nThis suggests infections are **not a common or inevitable outcome** of IUD use, but rather something providers screen for and can manage if needed.\n\n**Regarding discomfort/side effects:**\n- Some women experience **irregular bleeding**, especially in the first few months, but this \"usually becomes less or stops\" over time (Source 3)\n- If side effects are difficult to tolerate, providers should discuss the problems and explore solutions — and importantly, **no one should be pressured to continue** using a method that isn't working for them (Source 5)\n\n## My Suggestion:\n\nYour friend's experience is valid, but experiences vary from person to person. The best step would be to **speak with a healthcare provider** who can assess your individual health situation, answer your specific questions, and help you choose a method that feels right for *you*.\n\nWould you like information about what to expect during an IUD consultation?",
        "ground_truth": "I'm glad you're asking about this. IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication. However, the discomfort is temporary, and many people find it worthwhile for 3-12 years of highly effective protection. As for infections, modern IUDs have a very low infection risk. There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low. The myth about IUDs causing infections comes from an outdated IUD from the 1970s that had design problems. Today's IUDs are very safe. Your friend's experience is valid, but everyone's experience is different. Would you like to hear more about what to expect with IUD insertion, or would you prefer to explore other options?"

For relief, ibuprofen or other NSAIDs can help (WHO_FP_Handbook_2022.pdf, Page 204).\n\nRegarding infections: The IUD does not routinely cause infections, but there is higher risk if you or a partner have STI symptoms (e.g., pus, pain/burning when urinating, sores). In such cases, consider other methods if at very high risk (WHO_FP_Handbook_2022.pdf, Pages 195). If PID (pelvic infection) occurs, you can often continue using the IUD—no removal needed unless you prefer it, in which case discuss switching methods (WHO_FP_Handbook_2022.pdf, Page 206).\n\nDiscuss your concerns and personal health history with a healthcare provider to decide if it's right for you—they can check for risks and support your choice without pressure (WHO_FP_Handbook_2022.pdf, Page 209).

Please see a healthcare provider or family planning nurse for the specific instructions for your brand.  \n   Source: WHO FP Handbook 2022, p. 62.\n\n4. Tips to help you remember\n   • Link pill-taking to a daily activity (e.g., brushing teeth).  \n   • Set phone alarms or use a pill-reminder app.  \n   • Keep pills in a place you see every day (but out of reach of children).  \n\n5. When forgetting is frequent\n   If you often miss pills, you may want to discuss other contraceptive options that do not require daily action (e.g., injectables, implant, IUD) with a qualified healthcare provider so you can choose the method that best fits your life.\n\nIf you are unsure which type of pill you are using, or if you have had unprotected sex after missing pills, please visit the nearest health centre for personalised advice and, if needed, emergency contraception.",

However, individual health factors matter, and this is an important topic to discuss with a healthcare provider who can:\n\n- Review your personal and family health history\n- Discuss any specific risk factors you may have\n- Help you weigh the benefits and risks for your situation\n\n---\n\n**Would you like information about any specific type of contraceptive, or do you have other questions I can help with?**\n\n*Sources: WHO Family Planning Handbook, 2022*",
        "ground_truth": "The relationship between birth control pills and cancer is more complex than a simple yes or no. Research shows that while the pill may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, this risk returns to normal about 10 years after stopping. However, the pill significantly decreases the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial (uterine) cancer - and this protection lasts for years after stopping the pill. Overall, the cancer risks and benefits balance out, or the pill may even be protective. If you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, we should discuss your individual risk factors to find the best method for you."

However, the guidelines suggest that **greater protection from pregnancy is available** with other methods.\n\nIf STI protection is important for your situation, condoms would offer an advantage that withdrawal cannot provide.\n\nWould you like to discuss what factors matter most to you in choosing a method? A healthcare provider can also help you explore options that best fit your needs.",

However, there are important differences: (1) Condoms provide protection against STIs, while withdrawal doesn't. (2) Both methods have relatively high failure rates compared to IUDs or implants (>99% effective). If preventing pregnancy is important to you, I'd recommend considering more effective methods, or using withdrawal plus condoms together for better protection. Would you like to hear about methods with lower failure rates?"

It also relies on the man sensing the exact moment before ejaculation, which can be difficult for some couples (BCS Plus Toolkit, p. 145).\n\nWhat this means for you  \n– Pregnancy protection: Condoms generally provide better pregnancy protection than withdrawal, provided they are used every time.  \n– STI protection: Condoms add the benefit of reducing the risk of HIV and other STIs; withdrawal offers none.\n\nIf you are satisfied with withdrawal and use it correctly every time, you may continue. However, if you would like higher pregnancy protection or protection from STIs, you might consider adding or switching to condoms or another family-planning method. A health-care provider can talk through options that fit your needs and preferences.\n\nIf you need more personalised advice, please visit a nearby health centre or family-planning clinic.",

The guidelines mention that a healthcare provider should assess whether \"you have no conditions that prevent you from taking the Pill\" (BCS Plus Toolkit).\n\n### My recommendation:\n\nI would encourage you to **speak with a healthcare provider** who can:\n- Review your complete health history\n- Check for any conditions that might be relevant\n- Help you choose the contraceptive method that best fits your needs and health situation\n\nBeing overweight alone, based on the information I have, is not listed as a reason you cannot use birth control pills, but a provider can give you personalized guidance.\n\nIs there anything else about contraceptive options you'd like to know?",

You may want to consider using condoms alongside your chosen method for dual protection.\n\n2. **Individual Assessment**: The guidelines note that some methods may not be advised for women with very high risk of certain STIs (particularly chlamydia or gonorrhea), so an individual assessment is important.\n\n### What I Cannot Tell You:\n\nThe context provided doesn't give me complete information about **all** contraceptive methods available to you (such as IUDs, implants, injectables, etc.). \n\n### My Recommendation:\n\nI encourage you to visit a healthcare provider or family planning clinic in Rwanda who can:\n- Review your full medical history\n- Discuss the complete range of methods suitable for your situation\n- Consider any interactions with your specific ARV regimen\n- Help you choose the method that best fits your needs and preferences\n\nWould you like information about where to access family planning services?",

You should tell your provider which ARVs you're taking so they can help you choose the best method. Rwanda's integrated FP-HIV services make this easy. Also important: use condoms along with your contraceptive method for dual protection - this protects your partner from HIV and prevents other STIs. You have full access to all contraceptive options."

        "model_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your breast cancer diagnosis and treatment—please prioritize discussing contraception with your oncologist, gynecologist, or healthcare team, as they can tailor advice to your specific cancer type (e.g., hormone-receptor status), treatment regimen (chemo, radiation, hormone therapy like tamoxifen), and overall health. Pregnancy during cancer treatment is generally not recommended due to risks to you and the fetus, and some treatments cause temporary infertility.\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Hormonal contraceptives** (pills, patches, rings with estrogen, or most progestin-only options) are typically **not recommended** for active breast cancer. Estrogen can fuel hormone-sensitive cancers, and even progestin-only methods carry risks per guidelines from the CDC, WHO, and ACOG (often categorized as \"unacceptable health risk\").\n- Your treatment may induce temporary menopause or amenorrhea, reducing natural fertility, but it's not reliable contraception.\n- Always consider STI protection (e.g., condoms) alongside pregnancy prevention.\n\n### Recommended Contraception Options\nFocus on **non-hormonal methods**, which are generally safe during cancer treatment:\n\n1. **Barrier Methods** (highly effective with consistent use; no hormones):\n   - **Male or female condoms**: 98% effective with perfect use; also protect against STIs.\n   - **Diaphragm or cervical cap** (with spermicide): 94% effective; requires fitting by a provider.\n   - **Spermicide alone** (foams, gels, films): Less effective (~72%), but can combine with barriers.\n\n2. **Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD, e.g., Paragard)**:\n   - Non-hormonal, long-acting (up to 10–12 years).\n   - 99%+ effective.\n   - Can be inserted if safe per your doctor (may cause heavier periods, but treatment might already affect bleeding).\n\n3. **Sterilization**:\n   - **Tubal ligation** (for you) or **vasectomy** (for partner): Permanent, 99%+ effective.\n   - Consider if you don't want future pregnancies.\n\n4. **Abstinence or Outercourse**:\n   - 100% effective if no penile-vaginal intercourse.\n\n5. **Fertility Awareness/Natural Methods** (e.g., tracking cycles, apps):\n   - Less reliable (~76–88% effective); not ideal during treatment due to irregular cycles from chemo/hormones.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Ask your doctor about **fertility preservation** (e.g., egg freezing) before treatment if relevant.\n- Progestin-only options (e.g., mini-pill, implant like Nexplanon, Depo-Provera shot, or levonorgestrel IUD like Mirena) *might* be considered in rare cases (e.g., non-hormone-sensitive cancer), but evidence shows potential risks—**do not start without specialist approval**.\n- Emergency contraception: Copper IUD is safest; ulipristal (ella) or levonorgestrel (Plan B) may be okay once but avoid if hormone-sensitive cancer.\n\nYour team can check interactions with meds like tamoxifen (which reduces fertility but isn't contraception). For personalized guidance, resources like the American Cancer Society or Cancer Research UK have patient guides. Take care!",
        "ground_truth": "With current breast cancer, you should not use any hormonal contraception (pills, injection, implant, or hormonal IUD) as breast cancer is hormone-sensitive and these methods could potentially affect your treatment outcomes. Your best options are the copper IUD, which is >99% effective and hormone-free, or barrier methods like condoms or a diaphragm. The copper IUD is particularly recommended as it's highly effective and won't interfere with your cancer treatment. Please coordinate with your oncology team when choosing and placing a contraceptive method."

Statistically, that translates into a few fewer pregnancies per thousand users, but for any individual person both devices rank among the most effective reversible methods available.\n\nPick based on other factors  \nSince effectiveness is essentially a tie, most people choose between them based on:\n\nHormonal IUD  \n• Often makes periods much lighter or stops them altogether  \n• Can reduce menstrual cramps and endometriosis-related pain  \n• May cause hormonal side-effects (e.g., breast tenderness, mood changes, acne) in a minority of users  \n• Approved for 3–8 years of use depending on brand and local guidelines\n\nCopper IUD  \n• No hormones—good for those who prefer or must avoid hormonal exposure  \n• Periods may become heavier or crampier, especially in the first 3–6 months  \n• Approved for up to 10–12 years of use (some guidelines allow longer off-label)\n\nBottom line  \nIf near-perfect pregnancy prevention is your primary goal, both the hormonal and copper IUDs deliver. Let other considerations—bleeding pattern, side-effect profile, hormone preference, cost, and how long you want contraception—to guide the final choice. Always discuss individual medical factors with a qualified clinician.",

Continue the rest of the pack on your normal schedule.\n   \n2. **Use backup contraception**: For the next **7 days**, use a backup method like condoms every time you have sex (or avoid penetrative sex). This protects against pregnancy risk.\n\n### Additional Considerations Based on Timing:\n- **If you missed it by less than 24 hours** (e.g., just a few hours late): You're likely still protected—no backup needed beyond the above.\n- **If more than 24-48 hours late**:\n  | Week of Pack | Extra Action |\n  |--------------|-------------|\n  | **Days 1-7** | Backup for 7 days. Higher pregnancy risk if you've had sex since your last period. |\n  | **Days 8-14** | Backup for 7 days. |\n  | **Days 15-21** (or last week) | Finish the active pills, skip placebos, and start a new pack immediately. Backup for 7 days. |\n\n- **Had unprotected sex in the last 5 days?** Consider **emergency contraception** (like Plan B/levonorgestrel, available over-the-counter) ASAP—ideally within 72 hours, but up to 5 days. Ella (ulipristal) is another option up to 5 days. It's most effective sooner.\n\n### Progestin-Only Mini-Pill Note:\nIf you're on this (taken at the exact same time daily):\n- Take the missed pill ASAP.\n- Use backup for **48 hours** (or 7 days if >3 hours late).\n- If >3 hours late, pregnancy risk is higher—consider emergency contraception.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Check your pill pack insert** for brand-specific instructions (they vary slightly).\n- **Contact your doctor, pharmacist, or clinic** today for personalized advice, especially if you've missed more than one, are on antibiotics/other meds, or have vomiting/diarrhea.\n- **Set reminders** (app, alarm) to prevent future misses. Consider switching to a longer-acting method like the IUD, implant, or shot if daily pills are tough.\n\nYour protection isn't totally lost, but follow this to minimize risk. If you have more details (pill type, how late, recent sex), I can refine the advice!",
        "ground_truth": "Take the missed pill as soon as you remember, even if that means taking two pills in one day. Then continue taking your pills as scheduled, one pill each day. Since you only missed one pill, you don't need backup contraception. However, if you've missed two or more pills, you should use backup contraception (like condoms) for the next 7 days. Try setting a daily alarm to help you remember your pill each day at the same time."

Follow whatever instructions your own provider gave you.\n\n• Bleeding/cramping: Light bleeding or cramps are common for a few days. If you’re spotting, you may find pads more comfortable than tampons or menstrual cups for the first 24-48 hours, but using them won’t disturb the IUD.\n\n• Infection and expulsion: Water exposure doesn’t increase either risk. The IUD sits inside the uterus, protected by the cervix, so it can’t be “washed out” or moved by water pressure.\n\n• Check-ups: Perform your usual string check (or follow your provider’s schedule) and attend any recommended follow-up visit 4-6 weeks after insertion.\n\nCall your healthcare provider if you develop fever, increasing pelvic pain, foul-smelling discharge, or if you can’t feel the strings and think the IUD might have moved.\n\nIn short: once any immediate post-insertion guidance from your clinician has passed, swimming and bathing are completely safe with an IUD.",

        "model_response": "Being overweight does not automatically rule out the use of birth-control pills, but weight can influence which option is safest and most effective for you. Here are the key points to know before you decide:\n\n1. Effectiveness  \n • Combined estrogen-progestin pills (COCs) are still highly effective for most users with a high body-mass index (BMI). Some studies suggest a slight increase in pregnancy rates in people with obesity (BMI ≥ 30), especially with very-low-dose (20 µg ethinyl-estradiol) pills, but the difference is small.  \n • Progestin-only methods (the “mini-pill,” implant, hormonal IUD) and the copper IUD are not significantly affected by weight.\n\n2. Blood-clot (VTE) risk  \n • Both obesity and the estrogen in combined pills independently raise the risk of venous thromboembolism (deep-vein clots or pulmonary embolism). The absolute risk is still low, but it is higher than for non-obese, non-pill users.  \n • U.S. CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) classify combined pills in people with BMI ≥ 30 as category 2 (benefits generally outweigh risks) unless additional risk factors are present.  \n • If you have other clot-related risk factors—smoking after age 35, a personal or strong family history of clots, certain clotting disorders, recent major surgery, prolonged immobility—the combined pill could become category 3 or 4 (not recommended).\n\n3. Cardiovascular and metabolic considerations  \n • Obesity is also linked to hypertension, diabetes, and abnormal lipids. If you have any of these, your clinician may check blood pressure, fasting glucose/A1c, and lipids before prescribing, or suggest a non-estrogen method.\n\n4. Progestin-only options  \n • Mini-pill (norethindrone 0.35 mg or drospirenone 4 mg), implant (Nexplanon), levonorgestrel IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, etc.), and the depot shot (DMPA) do not carry an estrogen-related clot risk.  \n • Depot shot can cause weight gain in some users; discuss if that is a concern.\n\n5. Emergency contraception  \n • Levonorgestrel pills (Plan B, Take Action) work less well in people > 165–176 lb (75–80 kg).  \n • Ulipristal (ella) may lose effectiveness > 195 lb (88 kg).  \n • The copper IUD is the most effective emergency contraception regardless of weight.\n\n6. Practical tips  \n • If using combined pills, consider a standard (30–35 µg) or extended-cycle formulation to avoid very low doses.  \n • Take pills at the same time each day; with progestin-only pills you have a 3-hour (traditional norethindrone) or 24-hour (drospirenone) window.  \n • Regular follow-up is mostly to monitor blood pressure and address any side effects.\n\n7. When to avoid combined pills altogether  \n • Migraines with aura, uncontrolled hypertension, smoking > 15 cigarettes/day at age > 35, current breast cancer, liver disease, personal history of VTE, or major surgery with prolonged immobilization are all absolute or strong relative contraindications—regardless of weight.\n\nBottom line  \nOverweight or obesity alone usually does not prevent you from taking birth-control pills, but it can slightly reduce efficacy and raise the clot risk of estrogen-containing pills. Many users with higher BMI safely use combined pills; others prefer progestin-only or long-acting reversible contraception to avoid estrogen-related risks. Discuss your full medical history, weight, and personal preferences with a healthcare professional to choose the method that fits you best.",

The most effective options (over 99% with perfect use) are long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like IUDs and implants, but what works best for one person might not for another.\n\n### Key Factors to Consider\n- **Effectiveness**: Measured as \"perfect use\" (used exactly as directed) vs. \"typical use\" (real-world use, including mistakes).\n- **Convenience**: Daily, weekly, or set-it-and-forget-it?\n- **Side effects**: Hormonal methods can cause irregular bleeding, mood changes, or weight gain; non-hormonal avoid hormones.\n- **STI protection**: Only barrier methods (e.g., condoms) protect against STIs.\n- **Cost**: Many are free/affordable via insurance, clinics like Planned Parenthood, or programs like Title X.\n- **Reversibility**: Most are reversible except sterilization.\n\n### Comparison of Common Methods\nHere's a quick overview of highly effective options (all >99% perfect use unless noted):\n\n| Method                  | Effectiveness (Typical Use) | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------|------|----------|\n| **Implant** (e.g., Nexplanon, arm insert, 3-5 yrs) | 99%+ | Set-and-forget; highly effective; lightweight periods or none | Insertion/removal by doctor; possible irregular bleeding | Long-term, low-maintenance users |\n| **IUD (Hormonal)** (e.g., Mirena, 3-8 yrs) | 99%+ | Set-and-forget; lighter/cramp-free periods | Insertion can hurt; spotting initially | Those okay with minor procedure; heavy period sufferers |\n| **IUD (Copper)** (e.g., Paragard, 10+ yrs) | 99%+ | Hormone-free; emergency contraception option | Heavier periods/cramps | Hormone-avoiders wanting long-term |\n| **Sterilization** (tubal ligation or vasectomy) | 99%+ | Permanent; no ongoing effort | Not easily reversible; surgery | Those certain they don't want (more) kids |\n| **Depo-Provera Shot** (every 3 months) | 94% | No daily routine; lighter periods | Weight gain possible; delay in fertility return | Short-term, clinic access |\n| **Pill/Patch/Ring** (daily/weekly/monthly) | 91% | Reversible; regulates periods; non-invasive | Daily adherence needed; hormones | Those who want cycle control |\n| **Condoms** (male/female) | 87% (male), 79% (female) | STI protection; no hormones; OTC | Can break/slip; less effective alone | STI risk; casual sex |\n\n*Sources: CDC, WHO, Planned Parenthood data (2023). Effectiveness assumes no other factors like vomiting affecting pills/shots.*\n\n### Recommendations\n- **Most effective overall**: LARCs (IUD/implant) for low failure rates and ease—ideal if you're healthy and done with daily pills.\n- **For teens/new users**: Start with pills/condoms, then consider LARC.\n- **Hormone-free**: Copper IUD, condoms, or fertility awareness (77-98% effective, requires tracking).\n- **Emergency option**: Plan B (morning-after pill) or copper IUD (up to 5 days post-sex).\n\n**Always consult a doctor or clinic** for personalized advice—they'll screen for risks (e.g., blood clots with hormones, infections with IUDs).

Perfect use is often higher.\n\n### **Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) – Top Choice for Many (99%+ effective)**\nThese are \"set it and forget it\" options, lasting years.\n- **Hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena, Kyleena)**: Small T-shaped device inserted into uterus. Lasts 3–8 years. Lightens periods or stops them. Pros: Highly effective, low maintenance. Cons: Insertion discomfort, possible irregular bleeding initially. Hormone-free? No.\n- **Copper IUD (Paragard)**: Hormone-free, lasts up to 12 years. Pros: Emergency backup (up to 5 days after sex). Cons: Heavier periods/cramps.\n- **Implant (Nexplanon)**: Matchstick-sized rod in arm. Lasts 3 years. Pros: Very effective, private. Cons: Irregular bleeding, minor insertion procedure.\n\n### **Hormonal Methods (91–99% effective)**\nDaily/weekly/monthly commitment.\n- **Birth Control Pills**: Daily hormone pill. Pros: Regulates periods, reduces cramps/acne. Cons: Must remember daily; no STI protection. Types: Combined (estrogen + progestin) or progestin-only (safer for some).\n- **Patch (Xulane)**: Weekly skin patch. Similar to pills.\n- **Vaginal Ring (NuvaRing, Annovera)**: Flexible ring inserted monthly (or reusable yearly).\n- **Shot (Depo-Provera)**: Every 3 months at clinic. Pros: No daily action. Cons: Possible weight gain, bone density concerns with long-term use.\n- **Morning-After Pill**: Emergency option (Plan B up to 3 days post-sex; ella up to 5 days). 75–89% effective; not for routine use.\n\n### **Barrier & Short-Term Methods (71–88% effective)**\nNo hormones; good for STI protection (use condoms!).\n- **Male/Female Condoms**: 82–87% effective. Pros: STI protection, no prescription. Cons: Can break/slip.\n- **Diaphragm or Cervical Cap**: With spermicide, inserted before sex. 83–88% effective. Needs fitting.\n- **Spermicide, Sponge**: Over-the-counter, 68–86% effective alone.\n\n### **Natural/Behavioral Methods (76–88% effective)**\nNo devices/hormones.\n- **Fertility Awareness (tracking apps, temp, cervical mucus)**: Avoid sex on fertile days. Pros: Free, hormone-free. Cons: Requires diligence; apps like Natural Cycles can help but aren't foolproof.\n- **Withdrawal (pull-out)**: 78% effective. Risky due to pre-ejaculate.\n\n### **Permanent Options (99% effective)**\n- **Tubal Ligation (women) or Vasectomy (partners)**: Surgery for no more kids. Reversible? Sometimes, but not guaranteed.\n\n| Method | Hormone-Free? | STI Protection? | Cost (per year, approx.) |\n|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| IUD/Implant | Some yes | No | $0–1,300 (often free w/ins) |\n| Pill/Patch | No | No | $0–300 |\n| Condoms | Yes | Yes | $50–200 |\n| Fertility Tracking | Yes | No | Free–$100 (apps) |\n\n**Quick Tips:**\n- **Most effective overall**: LARCs like IUDs/implants (ideal if you want low effort).\n- **STI prevention**: Pair any method with condoms.\n- **Side effects**: Hormonal methods can cause spotting, mood changes, or rare risks (e.g., blood clots—screen for history).\n- **Access**: Free/low-cost via clinics; apps like Nurx/Clinic5 for telehealth delivery.\n- **Switching**: Easy to try/test methods.\n\nWhat are your priorities?

This is general educational information, not a substitute for a personalized discussion with a clinician who can review your health history in detail.\n\n1. First, think about your priorities  \n   • Effectiveness (typical-use pregnancy rates)  \n   • How long you’d like protection (days, months, years, permanent)  \n   • Hormonal vs. non-hormonal  \n   • How often you’re willing to think about it (daily pill vs. once-placed device)  \n   • Non-contraceptive benefits (lighter periods, acne control, reduced cramps)  \n   • Side-effects or medical conditions you want to avoid (e.g., migraines with aura, clotting disorders, heavy periods)  \n   • STI protection—external (male) and internal (female) condoms are the only methods that reduce risk of sexually transmitted infections.\n\n2. Highly effective, low-maintenance (“LARC” methods)  \n   a. Hormonal IUD (3–8 years depending on brand)  \n      • Releases a small amount of progestin locally  \n      • >99% effective; periods often get lighter or stop  \n      • Side-effects: irregular bleeding first few months, rare expulsion, rare perforation  \n      • Good if you want very light or no periods; not ideal if you dislike procedures involving your cervix.  \n   b. Copper IUD (up to 10–12 years)  \n      • Non-hormonal; >99% effective  \n      • Periods may be heavier/crampier at first  \n      • Can be used as emergency contraception if placed within 5 days after unprotected sex.  \n   c. Implant (etonogestrel rod in upper arm, 3 years)  \n      • >99% effective; insertion/removal through a tiny skin incision  \n      • Irregular bleeding is common; some experience acne, mood changes.\n\n3. Short-acting hormonal methods  \n   a. Combined pill (estrogen + progestin, taken daily)  \n      • 91% effective with typical use (about 1 in 10 users become pregnant in a year); >99% with perfect use  \n      • Regulates periods, can treat acne & cramps  \n      • Requires remembering daily; not recommended if you smoke ≥15 cigarettes/day or have migraines with aura, clotting disorders, certain hypertension or other contraindications.  \n   b. Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill” or newer 24-hour drospirenone pills)  \n      • Safer for people who can’t take estrogen (e.g., breastfeeding, clot risk)  \n      • Must be taken at roughly the same time each day; irregular bleeding possible.  \n   c. Patch (change weekly)  \n      • Similar hormones & benefits/risks to combined pills; 91% effective typical use  \n      • Visible on skin; slightly higher estrogen exposure—avoid if >198 lb for some brands.  \n   d. Vaginal ring  \n      – Monthly ring (3 weeks in, 1 week out) or yearly ring (replaced every month)  \n      • Similar effectiveness and estrogen risks to pills/patch, but lower daily dose; comfortable for most.  \n   e. Injection (depot-medroxyprogesterone, every 12–13 weeks)  \n      • 94% effective typical use; convenient for some, but must return every 3 months  \n      • Can cause irregular bleeding, weight gain, reversible bone-density loss; delay in return to fertility (average 9–10 months after last shot).\n\n4. Barrier methods & on-demand options  \n   • External (male) condoms – 82% effective typical use; STI protection; inexpensive/free; use every act  \n   • Internal (female) condoms – 79% effective; STI protection; may feel less tight for partner  \n   • Diaphragm or cervical cap – 80–88% effective with spermicide; reusable; need fitting for some brands  \n   • Spermicides or vaginal pH gels – 72–86% effective alone; can irritate tissue  \n   • Withdrawal – 78% effective typical use; no cost, but requires good partner control  \n   • Fertility awareness methods – ~77–98% depending on diligence; daily monitoring of cycles/temp; no side effects but requires abstinence or barrier during fertile window.\n\n5. Permanent options (for when you’re sure you’re done with fertility)  \n   • Tubal ligation / removal (female sterilization) – >99% effective; laparoscopy or postpartum; permanent  \n   • Vasectomy (for partner) – >99% effective after confirmation test; simpler, cheaper, lower risk than tubal surgery; use backup until sperm-free.\n\n6. Emergency contraception (EC) – backup, not primary method  \n   • Levonorgestrel pill (“Plan B,” generics) – within 72 h, modestly less effective after; OTC  \n   • Ulipristal acetate (“ella”) – up to 120 h, more effective esp. on days 3–5 and if BMI >25; Rx in U.S.  \n   • Copper IUD – most effective EC; up to 5 days (some data up to 10 days) after unprotected sex; then provides long-term contraception.\n\n7. Common non-contraceptive considerations  \n   • Heavy, painful periods → hormonal IUD, combined pill, ring, patch, or depot shot can help  \n   • Acne → certain combined pills approved for acne; some progestins may worsen it  \n   • Migraines with aura, clotting disorders, strong family history of VTE → avoid estrogen; consider progestin-only or non-hormonal  \n   • Endometriosis → continuous combined pills, hormonal IUD, or depot shot often used  \n   • Breastfeeding → progestin-only pill, shot, implant, IUDs safe; avoid estrogen until ~6 weeks postpartum\n\n8. A quick effectiveness snapshot (typical use)  \n   >99% → IUDs, implant, sterilization  \n   94–97% → injection  \n   91% → pill, patch, ring  \n   79–88% → condoms, diaphragm, fertility awareness, withdrawal  \n   Note: Perfect use raises all of these, but “typical” reflects real-world mistakes.\n\n9. Practical next steps  \n   • Make a short list of what matters most to you (e.g., “I want the most effective method that’s low maintenance and hormone-free” → copper IUD; “I want lighter periods and fewer cramps” → hormonal IUD or combined pill).  \n   • Check any health conditions or medications that could interact (certain seizure meds, HIV meds, rifampin, St. John’s wort can lower hormonal method effectiveness).  \n   • Schedule a conversation with a clinician or family-planning clinic. They’ll review your blood-pressure, smoking status, migraine history, clot risks, and do any needed exams or tests.  \n   • If STI risk exists, consider dual protection: a reliable birth-control method + condoms.  \n   • Think about cost and access: many insurance plans and public programs cover LARC and other methods at low or no cost; Planned Parenthood or Title X clinics can help if uninsured.\n\n10. Questions you can ask your provider  \n   • Am I medically eligible for estrogen-containing methods?  \n   • What side effects should I expect in the first few months and what’s normal vs. concerning?  \n   • How soon can I become pregnant if I stop this method?  \n   • How is the device inserted/removed?  \n   • What if I miss a pill/patch/ring?  \n   • Do any of my medications interact with this method?  \n   • How do I recognize warning signs of a clot or infection?\n\nFeel free to let me know any specific preferences or health factors (e.g., “I have heavy periods” or “I can’t take estrogen”), and I can narrow the options further. Ultimately, the “best” birth-control method is the one you can use correctly and consistently, matches your health profile, and fits your lifestyle.",
        "ground_truth": "I'd be happy to help you find a method that works for you. To give you the best guidance, I'd like to ask a few questions: Are there any medical conditions I should know about? Do you have preferences about hormonal vs non-hormonal methods? How important is effectiveness vs. having lighter or no periods? Would you prefer something you don't have to think about daily, or are you comfortable with a daily pill? Also, how soon might you want to become pregnant in the future? Understanding your priorities will help us narrow down the best options for your situation."

        "model_response": "It's great that you're thinking proactively about your reproductive health and listening to your body—many people choose to take breaks from hormonal birth control (like the pill, patch, ring, or implant) for reasons like side effects or just a reset. However, stopping hormonal BC means you'll need reliable backup contraception to prevent pregnancy, as fertility can return quickly (sometimes within days or weeks). No method is 100% foolproof except abstinence, so here's what you can do, with effectiveness rates based on typical use (real-world scenarios) from sources like the CDC and Planned Parenthood:\n\n### 1. **Consult a Healthcare Provider First**\n   - **Why?** They can check your health, discuss your cycle history, and recommend personalized options. They might test for STIs or suggest bloodwork. If you've been on hormonal BC long-term, your natural cycle might take 1-3 months to regulate.\n   - Schedule an appointment with a gynecologist, clinic like Planned Parenthood, or your primary care doctor ASAP.\n\n### 2. **Switch to Non-Hormonal or Barrier Methods**\n   These don't affect your hormones and can be used immediately:\n   - **Condoms (male or internal/female)**: 87% effective typical use. Easy to get (no prescription), protects against STIs, and great for casual or new partners. Use with lube to prevent breakage.\n   - **Copper IUD (Paragard)**: Over 99% effective, lasts up to 10-12 years, inserted by a doctor. Hormone-free, works right away, and you can have it removed anytime to resume fertility.\n   - **Diaphragm or cervical cap**: 88% effective with spermicide (83% without). Fitted by a doctor, reusable, inserted before sex.\n   - **Contraceptive sponge or spermicide**: 76-88% effective. Over-the-counter, but less reliable alone—best combined with condoms.\n\n### 3. **Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM) or Natural Family Planning**\n   - Track your fertile window using apps (e.g., Natural Cycles, Clue), basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or ovulation tests. Avoid unprotected sex during fertile days (about 8-10 days per cycle).\n   - **Effectiveness**: 76-88% typical use (up to 99% with perfect tracking). Requires daily effort, consistent cycles, and no breastfeeding/recent hormonal BC disruption. Apps like Natural Cycles are FDA-cleared as contraception when used correctly.\n   - **Pro tip**: Combine with condoms for \"double protection\" (boosts effectiveness to 99%+).\n\n### 4. **Other Temporary Options**\n   - **Withdrawal (pull-out method)**: Only 78% effective—**not recommended** as primary due to pre-ejaculate risks.\n   - **Abstinence or outercourse**: 100% effective if no penile-vaginal contact.\n   - **Emergency contraception**: Plan B (within 72 hours) or Ella (up to 5 days) as backup if something fails—available over-the-counter.\n\n### Quick Tips for Success\n- **Track everything**: Use an app to log your cycle from day 1 off BC.\n- **Partner involvement**: Discuss with your partner(s) for shared responsibility.\n- **STI protection**: Condoms are key if not monogamous.\n- **Signs of ovulation**: Watch for changes in mucus, temperature, or mittelschmerz (ovulation pain).\n- **What to avoid**: Don't rely on \"rhythm method\" alone (outdated and inaccurate).\n\nIf pregnancy would be unwelcome, the copper IUD or condoms + FAM are your safest bets for a true \"break.\" Everyone's body is different, so professional guidance is key—reach out to a provider today.

        "model_response": "Here are the main points to think through before you stop your current birth-control method and some reliable ways to avoid pregnancy while you “take a break.”  \n(This information is educational, not a substitute for personal medical care. If possible, review your plans with a clinician who knows your health history.)\n\n1. Decide why you want the break  \n• If you are worried about “build-up” of hormones, know that modern contraceptives do not accumulate in the body; most are cleared within days. A “rest” is usually not medically necessary.  \n• If you are experiencing side-effects (mood, bleeding, libido, migraines, etc.), there may be another formulation or dose that solves the problem without losing pregnancy protection. Talking this through with a provider can save you trial-and-error later.\n\n2. Put the new method in place before you stop the old one  \nFertility can return immediately after you stop pills, the ring, the patch, or remove the implant; within days to weeks after your last Depo-Provera shot; and right away after removing an IUD. Have your next method ready to go first or use backup condoms from the moment you stop.\n\n3. Highly effective non-hormonal options (no daily attention after placement)  \n• Copper IUD (ParaGard or similar)  \n  – Effectiveness: > 99% (typical use failure rate ≈ 0.8% per year)  \n  – Works for 10+ years, can be removed any time fertility is desired.  \n  – Periods may be heavier or crampier at first.  \n  – Bonus: also the most effective form of emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.  \n• Partner/your sterilization  \n  – Tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy for you; vasectomy for a partner.  \n  – Intended to be permanent; reversal is possible but not guaranteed.\n\n4. Barrier methods and how to make them work better  \n(Remember: these protect only while they’re in place, so consistency is crucial.)  \n• External (male) condom: 13% typical-use failure per year. Combine with spermicide or withdrawal to lower risk.  \n• Internal (female) condom: 21% typical-use failure.  \n• Diaphragm or cervical cap (with spermicide): 14–27% typical-use failure; must be refitted after pregnancy or major weight change.  \n• Spermicidal film/gel alone: 21%+ failure—best as a back-up, not solo.  \n• You can layer methods—e.g., condoms + diaphragm—to approach the effectiveness of the pill without hormones.\n\n5. Fertility Awareness–Based Methods (FABMs)  \n• Track cycle length, cervical mucus, and/or basal body temperature to identify fertile days and abstain or use condoms then.  \n• Typical-use failure ranges 2–23% yearly depending on diligence and training.  \n• Best for highly motivated couples comfortable with daily tracking and periods of abstinence or backup.  \n• Smartphone apps can help, but formal instruction (e.g., Sympto-Thermal method training) significantly improves success rates.\n\n6. Short-term or “bridging” strategies  \nIf you’re not ready to commit to an IUD or barrier-only approach, you can:  \n• Use condoms + spermicide every time from the day you stop hormones until you reach a decision.  \n• Schedule IUD placement first, then cease pills once the IUD is in place.  \n• Switch to a lower-dose pill, progestin-only pill, or hormonal IUD (very low systemic exposure) instead of quitting hormones cold turkey.\n\n7. Emergency contraception (EC) safety net  \n• Copper IUD: up to 5 days after unprotected sex; most effective form of EC.  \n• Levonorgestrel (“Plan B” and generics): shop-shelf in most areas; best within 72 hrs, some effect up to 5 days.  \n• Ulipristal acetate (Ella): prescription in many places; works up to 120 hrs; slightly more effective than levonorgestrel, especially if BMI ≥25.  \nKeep a dose at home if access might be delayed.\n\n8. Protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  \nBarrier methods (external/internal condoms) are the only contraceptives that also reduce STI risk. If you have multiple or new partners, consider testing schedules and HPV vaccination for full protection.\n\n9. Expect some cycle changes after stopping hormones  \n• Your natural cycle usually returns within 1–3 months, but a minority need up to 6 months.  \n• Break-through bleeding, acne, or cramps you had before starting the pill may come back.  \n• If no period after 3 months (or 6 months for Depo users), take a pregnancy test and see a clinician.\n\n10. Have a check-in plan  \n• Make one appointment (or tele-health visit) now to discuss method choice and another in 3–6 months to be sure you’re satisfied and side-effect-free.  \n• If you experience severe pain, very heavy bleeding, or suspect pregnancy, don’t wait—seek care promptly.\n\nKey take-away: The safest way to “take a break” from hormonal birth control without risking pregnancy is to line up a non-hormonal method with proven effectiveness—most commonly a copper IUD or consistent condom use backed by another barrier or FABM. A brief consultation with a healthcare professional will let you weigh the pros and cons for your personal health situation and get any necessary prescriptions or devices in place before you stop your current contraceptive.",

Quick overview of the main categories \n• Barrier methods  \n  – Male condoms  \n  – Internal (female) condoms  \n  – Diaphragm or cervical cap (used with spermicide)  \n  – Sponge with spermicide  \n  Protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs): condoms do; others generally don’t.  \n  Typical-use effectiveness: roughly 72–88 % for most, 85 % for male condoms; improves with perfect use.\n\n• Short-acting hormonal methods  \n  – Combination pill (estrogen + progestin, taken daily)  \n  – Progestin-only pill (“mini-pill,” taken daily)  \n  – Patch (changed weekly)  \n  – Vaginal ring (left in place for three weeks, removed for one)  \n  – Injection (every 3 months)  \n  No STI protection. Typical-use effectiveness: about 91 % (injection is ~94 %).\n\n• Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)  \n  – Hormonal IUD (3–8 years, depending on brand)  \n  – Copper IUD (up to 10–12 years)  \n  – Hormonal implant in the arm (3 years, some brands 5)  \n  Very low maintenance once placed. Effectiveness >99 %. No STI protection.\n\n• Emergency contraception  \n  – Pills containing levonorgestrel (within 72 hours, sooner is better)  \n  – Pills containing ulipristal acetate (within 120 hours)  \n  – Copper IUD (can be placed up to 5 days after intercourse; most effective EC)  \n  Not intended for routine use.\n\n• Permanent methods (for people who are sure they’re done with fertility)  \n  – Tubal ligation / salpingectomy  \n  – Vasectomy  \n  Effectiveness >99 %, irreversible or difficult to reverse.\n\n• Fertility awareness / natural family planning  \n  Track fertile window with temperature, cervical mucus, or calendar methods.  \n  Effectiveness ranges from ~77 % to >95 % depending on precision and consistency. No STI protection.\n\n2. How people usually decide  \n• Effectiveness: LARC and sterilization are highest; barrier and fertility-awareness are lower unless used perfectly.  \n• Health considerations: some people shouldn’t use estrogen-containing methods (e.g., migraines with aura, clotting disorders, smoking over age 35).  \n• Side effects and bleeding patterns: progestin-only can mean irregular bleeding; copper IUD may increase cramping/flow at first.  \n• Ease and privacy: daily pill vs. set-it-and-forget-it IUD; partner involvement for condoms; visibility of certain methods.  \n• STI risk: condoms or dual protection (condom plus another method).  \n• Cost and access: up-front cost can be high for IUDs/implants but often covered by insurance or subsidized clinics.  \n• Future fertility plans: LARC is reversible, sterilization is not.  \n• Personal preferences, cultural or religious beliefs.\n\n3. Next steps you can take  \n• Make a short list of your priorities (e.g., “I want something I don’t have to remember daily,” or “I need STI protection,” or “I prefer non-hormonal”).  \n• Bring that list to a healthcare provider or family-planning clinic. They can:  \n  – Review your medical history and check for any contraindications (e.g., blood-pressure issues, migraines, medication interactions).  \n  – Explain insertion or use techniques, expected side effects, and what to do if problems arise.  \n  – Provide prescriptions, placement, or training on proper use.  \n• If you don’t have a regular clinician, consider:  \n  – Planned Parenthood or a local sexual-health clinic (often sliding-scale or free).  \n  – Telehealth services that specialize in reproductive health.  \n  – Government programs (Title X in the U.S.) for low-cost contraception.\n\nKey takeaway: The “best” method is the one that matches your health profile, lifestyle, and preferences. A clinician can help narrow the choice quickly once you share what matters most to you.",
        "ground_truth": "I understand there are a lot of options and it can feel overwhelming. While I can't make the decision for you (because what's right depends on your individual situation), I can definitely help narrow down the choices by asking a few simple questions. Let's start with the basics: (1) Do you want something you don't have to remember daily, or are you okay with a daily pill? (2) Do you have any concerns about using hormones? (3) How important is it that you absolutely not get pregnant right now? Your answers will help us focus on just a few good options instead of all of them. Does that sound okay?"

Before you leave the maternity ward (within the first 24–48 hours after delivery).  \n   • A nurse, midwife, or counsellor should review your contraceptive options and help you start a method if you want one right away (for example condoms, an IUD, an implant, or beginning the Lactational Amenorrhoea Method if you will breast-feed exclusively).\n\n2. At your first post-natal check-up (usually 7 days and/or 6 weeks after birth).  \n   • If you did not choose a method in the hospital, or if you wish to change, this visit is another opportunity. Methods such as the progestin-only pill, injectables, or implants can be started at this time; combined pills are usually started after 6 weeks if you are breastfeeding.\n\n3. During your baby’s immunisation visits (6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, etc.).  \n   • Many clinics integrate family-planning services into these appointments so you don’t need an extra visit.\n\n4. Any time you ask.  \n   • You don’t have to wait for a scheduled visit. If you have questions or want to start a method sooner, simply tell the nurse or midwife before you’re discharged or return to the clinic whenever it is convenient.\n\nIf no one has spoken to you about family planning yet, it is absolutely acceptable to ask right now—before you leave the health centre. The staff can then:\n\n• Explain how quickly fertility can return (as soon as 4 weeks if not exclusively breastfeeding).  \n• Review which methods are safe for you, considering delivery type (vaginal or caesarean), bleeding, breastfeeding, and any medical conditions.  \n• Help you start or schedule the method you choose.\n\nKey points to remember\n\n• Exclusive breastfeeding can protect you from pregnancy for up to 6 months if you have not had a menstrual period (Lactational Amenorrhoea Method, LAM).  \n• If you do not plan to breastfeed exclusively, or want additional protection, start another method as soon as you are medically eligible.  \n• Your partner is welcome at counselling sessions if you wish.\n\nSo, the best time is now—before discharge—or at the latest during your first post-natal or immunisation visit. Feel free to let any staff member know that you would like to discuss family planning, and they will arrange counselling for you.",

In Rwanda, you can access family planning services like this without parental consent at age 16, and they're free or low-cost at public health centers. Let's go over the key facts based on WHO guidelines to help you decide.\n\n### Medical Eligibility (WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria)\n- For a healthy 16-year-old with no other health issues (like obesity, smoking, or certain chronic conditions), Depo-Provera is **Category 2** for initiation and continuation. This means the benefits usually outweigh the risks, but your provider should screen you first.\n- If you have conditions like severe liver disease, breast cancer history, or uncontrolled high blood pressure, it may not be suitable (Category 3 or 4). Always get checked.\n\n### Effectiveness\n- **Perfect use** (getting shots every 12-13 weeks on time): 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.\n- **Typical use** (with some delays): About 94-96% effective.\n\nIt's a good method if you want something private, long-acting (lasts 3 months per shot), and don't mind injections.\n\n### Benefits\n- No daily pills to remember.\n- Often stops periods after a few months (lighter or no bleeding for many).\n- Reversible—fertility returns quickly after stopping.\n- Doesn't contain estrogen, so safer for those who can't use pills or patches.\n\n### Possible Side Effects and What to Expect\n- Common (affect 1 in 10 or more users):\n  - Irregular spotting or heavy bleeding (first 3-6 months).\n  - No periods (after 1 year, up to 70% of users).\n  - Weight gain (average 2-3 kg in first year).\n  - Headaches, mood changes, or acne.\n- For adolescents: Possible small effect on bone density with long-term use (over 2 years). WHO recommends counseling on this—use the shortest time needed, consider calcium-rich diet/exercise, and switch methods if stopping later.\n- Rare but serious: Allergic reaction to injection, or signs of blood clots (very low risk).\n\n**Warning signs—return to your provider or clinic right away if:**\n- Severe headache, vision changes, or dizziness.\n- Chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg pain/swelling.\n- Heavy bleeding that soaks a pad hourly for several hours.\n- Yellow skin/eyes, severe abdominal pain, or depression.\n\n### Next Steps\nThis is general info—your provider can check your eligibility, give the first shot if suitable, and answer personal questions. Visit a nearby health center or hospital (like in your district). They offer counseling in Kinyarwanda and can discuss alternatives like pills, implants, IUDs, condoms, or emergency contraception.\n\nWhat else are you considering, or do you have health details to share?

        "model_response": "Below is the information that is consistent with the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook/MEC and the Balanced Counseling Strategy+, and it aligns with Rwanda’s National Family Planning Policy.\n\n1. Pregnancy-prevention effectiveness  \n   • Male (external) condom  \n     – Typical use: about 13 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year of use (≈ 87 % effective).  \n     – Perfect use: about 2 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈ 98 % effective).  \n\n   • Female (internal) condom  \n     – Typical use: about 21 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈ 79 % effective).  \n     – Perfect use: about 5 pregnancies per 100 women in the first year (≈ 95 % effective).\n\n   “Typical use” reflects how most people actually use the method (sometimes incorrectly or not every time). “Perfect use” assumes the condom is used correctly every single act of sex.\n\n2. Important additional benefits  \n   • The only contraceptive method that also provides dual protection against HIV and most other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  \n   • Readily available without a prescription in Rwanda; free or very low-cost in public facilities and many community-based distribution points.  \n   • No medical conditions in which condoms are restricted (WHO MEC category 1 for all users).\n\n3. How to use correctly (male condom example)  \n   • Use a new condom with every act of vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  \n   • Put the condom on the erect penis before any genital contact.  \n   • Pinch the tip to leave space for semen, then unroll to the base.  \n   • After ejaculation, hold the rim and withdraw while still erect, then dispose of it safely.  \n   • Store condoms in a cool, dry place—avoid heat or sharp objects.\n\n4. Possible side effects / concerns  \n   • Temporary loss of sensation or interruption of sexual flow for some users.  \n   • Rare latex allergy or irritation; polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms are an option if latex sensitive.  \n   • Some people notice vaginal dryness; water-based lubricants can help. Oil-based products (petroleum jelly, body oil) weaken latex condoms.\n\n5. Warning signs and when to seek care  \n   • Persistent itching, rash, swelling, shortness of breath, or hives after condom use—could signal latex allergy.  \n   • Any sign of STI (unusual discharge, sores, pain). Visit a health facility for assessment and treatment.  \n   • If a condom breaks, slips, or is forgotten, emergency contraception can be taken within 120 hours; seek a provider promptly.\n\n6. Tips to improve effectiveness  \n   • Practice putting condoms on outside the sexual situation.  \n   • Keep a supply at hand so you are not caught unprepared.  \n   • Combine with another method (e.g., condoms + hormonal contraception) for even higher pregnancy protection and continued STI prevention (“dual method use”).\n\n7. Autonomy and confidentiality in Rwanda  \n   • Anyone, including adolescents and unmarried people, can obtain condoms without parental or partner consent.  \n   • Services are confidential and should be non-judgmental.  \n   • If cost is a concern, ask at public health centers or community health workers for free supplies.\n\nIf you need more help choosing or using condoms, or experience any of the warning signs above, please visit a qualified healthcare provider or a nearby family-planning clinic.",

        "model_response": "Here is a concise, evidence-based overview drawn from the 2022 WHO Family Planning Handbook, the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and the Balanced Counseling Strategy (BCS+).\n\n1. What is “emergency contraception” (EC)?\n   • A method used AFTER unprotected sex, contraceptive failure (e.g., broken condom), or sexual assault to prevent pregnancy.  \n   • Does not disrupt an established pregnancy and is not the same as medical abortion.\n\n2. Available EC options and how well they work\n\nA. Copper-bearing IUD (Cu-IUD) inserted within 5 days of the earliest possible ovulation*\n   • Effectiveness: >99% (fewer than 1 pregnancy per 100 users).  \n   • Remains highly effective for at least 10–12 years if left in place as ongoing contraception.  \n   • MEC category: 1 for most women; check MEC tables for exceptions (e.g., current pelvic infection = MEC 4).\n\nB. Levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (LNG-ECPs) 1.5 mg single dose, or 0.75 mg × 2 doses 12 h apart\n   • Effectiveness: If 1000 women take it within 72 h, about 14 will become pregnant (≈86–88 % effective).  \n     ‑ Highest protection (≈95–99 %) when taken within the first 24 h.  \n     ‑ Some protection up to 120 h (5 days), but efficacy declines each day.  \n   • MEC category: 1 for all women, including adolescents and breastfeeding women.\n\nC. Ulipristal acetate (UPA-ECP) 30 mg single dose\n   • Effectiveness: About 98–99 % when used within 120 h; maintains consistent effectiveness across the 5-day window.  \n   • Not recommended during breastfeeding for the first 7 days after use (WHO: “caution”). MEC 2 for breastfeeding <6 weeks, MEC 1 thereafter.\n\nD. Yuzpe combined estrogen-progestin regimen (older method; e.g., 100 µg ethinylestradiol + 1.0 mg LNG, 2 doses 12 h apart)\n   • Effectiveness: Roughly 57–75 % (more pregnancies compared with dedicated ECPs).  \n   • Causes more nausea/vomiting. Generally considered a back-up when dedicated ECPs are unavailable.\n\n*If the date of ovulation is uncertain, a Cu-IUD can be inserted up to 5 days after the last act of unprotected intercourse.\n\n3. Key counseling points (non-directive)\n   • The sooner EC is used, the better it works.  \n   • EC does NOT protect against pregnancy from sex that happens later in the same cycle—start or resume a regular contraceptive method right away.  \n   • EC does NOT protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs); offer condoms and STI screening when appropriate.  \n   • Repeat use of ECPs is safe but less effective and more expensive than having a regular, ongoing contraceptive method.  \n   • In Rwanda, adolescents and unmarried women have the right to obtain EC without parental or partner consent, free or at low cost in public facilities.\n\n4. Possible side-effects and warning signs\n\nA. Emergency contraceptive pills\n   • Short-term: mild nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, headache, slight bleeding or change in next menses.  \n   • Menses usually comes on time or within ±7 days. If >4 weeks late, do a pregnancy test.  \n   • No evidence of long-term fertility problems or harm to an existing pregnancy.  \n   • Seek care if: severe abdominal pain (could indicate ectopic pregnancy, although rare).\n\nB. Copper IUD\n   • During insertion: cramping, dizziness.  \n   • After insertion: heavier or more painful periods for some users, especially in the first 3–6 months.  \n   • Warning signs (PAINS): Period late (pregnancy), Abdominal pain, Infection exposure, Not feeling well (fever/chills), Strings missing/shorter/longer—seek care promptly.\n\n5. When to follow up\n   • No mandatory follow-up after ECPs unless there is heavy bleeding, severe pain, or menstrual delay >4 weeks.  \n   • For Cu-IUD: routine check-up in 4–6 weeks or sooner if any warning signs.\n\n6. Summary effectiveness chart (failure rates)\n\nMethod (one-time use)     | Pregnancies per 100 users\nCopper IUD                 | <1\nUPA-ECP 30 mg              | ~1–2\nLNG-ECP ≤72 h              | ~14\nYuzpe regimen              | ~25–45\n\nRemember, you are free to choose whichever method best suits your needs and circumstances. If anything is unclear or you have medical conditions, consult a trained healthcare provider for individualized guidance.",

Many people choose to combine it with condoms or another barrier to improve protection.\n\nHow spermicide works\n• The most common active ingredient is nonoxynol-9, a chemical that inactivates sperm.  \n• It comes as a gel, foam, film, tablet, or suppository that is placed deep in the vagina before every act of intercourse.  \n• Most products need 10–15 minutes to melt/foam and are effective for about 1 hour. A fresh dose is needed for each act of sex, even if it is within the same hour.\n\nWHO Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC)\n• Category 1 (no restriction) for most women.  \n• Category 4 (unacceptable health risk) for women at high risk of HIV acquisition, because frequent use of nonoxynol-9 can irritate vaginal tissue and may increase HIV risk.  \n• Category 2 for women living with HIV who are clinically well and on ART.  \nIf you are unsure about your HIV risk, talk with a health-care provider first.\n\nAdvantages\n• Can be bought without a prescription in many countries.  \n• Used only when needed; no daily routine.  \n• Gives immediate control to the person who inserts it.  \n• No effect on breastfeeding.  \n• Few systemic (whole-body) side-effects.\n\nPossible side-effects\n• Mild vaginal or penile irritation or burning (usually short-lived).  \n• Allergy (rare). Stop using and seek care if you develop rash or swelling.  \n• Frequent use (more than twice a day) may increase risk of genital lesions or HIV acquisition.\n\nWarning signs – seek care if you notice:\n• Persistent burning, itching, unusual discharge, sores, or rash in the genital area.  \n• Signs of allergy (swelling of lips, tongue, or face; difficulty breathing).  \n• You think you might be pregnant and do not wish to be.\n\nInstructions for correct use\n1. Wash hands.  \n2. Check the expiry date.  \n3. Insert the full dose high into the vagina, close to the cervix.  \n4. Wait the time specified on the package (usually 10–15 minutes).  \n5. Have sex within the product’s effective window (usually ≤1 hour).  \n6. Insert a new dose for every act of intercourse.  \n7. Do not douche or wash the vagina for at least 6 hours afterward.  \n8. For greater protection, consider using a male or female condom as well (dual protection against both pregnancy and STIs, including HIV).\n\nAccess in Rwanda\n• Spermicides are less commonly stocked in public clinics than other methods, but some pharmacies may carry them.  \n• Family-planning services at public facilities are free or low-cost; staff can tell you where to find spermicidal products if you choose them.  \n• Adolescents and all women, married or not, have the right to obtain family-planning methods without needing anyone else’s permission.\n\nKey take-home points\n• Spermicide alone is moderately effective but less reliable than pills, injectables, implants, IUDs, or condoms.  \n• Correct use every single time is essential.  \n• It does not protect against STIs; frequent use can raise HIV risk in women at high exposure risk.  \n• You are free to choose, change, or stop any method whenever you wish. If you would like a more effective option or dual protection, a health-care provider can help you explore all available methods.",

        "model_response": "Here is the timing guidance that WHO gives for depot-medroxy-progesterone acetate (DMPA, often called “Depo-Provera”):\n\n1. Routine schedule  \n   • Give one injection every 12 weeks (3 months).\n\n2. Acceptable window  \n   • You may come as early as 2 weeks before the 12-week mark (week 10).  \n   • You may come up to 4 weeks after the 12-week mark (week 16).  \n   • Injections given anywhere in this 10- to 16-week window do NOT require any backup contraception or pregnancy test as long as you have not already become pregnant.\n\n3. Late injections (more than 16 weeks since the last shot)  \n   • You should have a pregnancy assessment (history and/or test).  \n   • If pregnancy is reasonably excluded, you can receive the injection the same day, but you need to use condoms or abstain for the next 7 days.  \n   • If you had unprotected sex in the past 5 days, consider emergency contraception before or at the same visit.\n\nWhere you are now  \n• Your last shot was exactly 12 weeks ago, which is the ideal time for the next dose.  \n• Try to get the injection as soon as possible. You are still within the on-time window, so no extra precautions are needed if you receive it now.\n\nEffectiveness (for future reference)  \n• Typical-use pregnancy rate: about 6 per 100 women in the first year (94 % effective).  \n• Perfect-use pregnancy rate: about 0.2 per 100 women in the first year (>99 % effective).  \nStaying on schedule is the key to achieving the higher end of effectiveness.\n\nCommon side-effects you may notice  \n• Changes in bleeding: lighter, irregular, spotting, or no bleeding at all after a few injections.  \n• Possible weight change, headaches, or mood changes.  \n• Delayed return to fertility after stopping (median about 10 months to first ovulation, but can be shorter or longer).\n\nWarning signs—seek care promptly if you experience  \n• Severe lower-abdominal pain (could signal ectopic pregnancy).  \n• Very heavy vaginal bleeding.  \n• Signs of pregnancy.  \n• Severe headaches with changes in vision.  \n• Signs of infection at the injection site (fever, redness, swelling).\n\nYour rights in Rwanda  \n• You can receive family-planning services—including Depo-Provera—without needing anyone else’s permission, at little or no cost in public facilities.\n\nIf anything is unclear, or if more than 16 weeks ever pass between shots, please visit a qualified provider for personalized guidance.",
        "ground_truth": "You should get your next Depo-Provera shot now, at 12 weeks. You're right on schedule! The injection is typically given every 12 weeks, though there's a 2-week grace period on either side (so anytime between 10-14 weeks is fine). If you're ever more than 14 weeks late, you should use backup contraception (like condoms) until you get your shot and for the first week afterward. Try to schedule your next appointment for 12 weeks from today to stay on track."

The handbook notes that weight changes naturally as life circumstances change and as people age. A few women may experience sudden weight changes, but these typically reverse after stopping the pills.\n\n**Progestin-Only Injectables (like DMPA):**\nThe evidence is somewhat different for injectable contraceptives. The WHO handbook indicates that women using DMPA gain **an average of 1–2 kg per year**, though some of this may be normal weight gain that occurs with aging. However:\n- Some users lose weight or have no significant change\n- Asian women in particular do not tend to gain weight when using DMPA\n- Individual responses vary considerably\n\n### What This Means for You:\n\n- **Different methods affect people differently** – your experience may not match the average\n- **The pill** is generally not associated with significant weight changes for most women\n- **Injectables** may cause modest weight gain for some users\n\n### My Recommendation:\n\nSince weight concerns are important to you, I'd encourage you to discuss this with a healthcare provider who can:\n- Help you choose a method that fits your priorities\n- Monitor any changes if you're concerned\n- Explore alternatives if needed\n\nWould you like information about any specific contraceptive method?",

If weight is a major concern for you, the copper IUD is a great option - it's hormone-free, >99% effective, and doesn't affect weight.

Better options for you include the copper IUD or hormonal IUD (hormone-free or low-dose local hormone), progestin-only pills, or the contraceptive implant. These methods won't increase your cardiovascular risk and are all highly effective (>99%). I'd recommend discussing this with both your diabetes care team and a family planning provider to choose the safest option for you."
