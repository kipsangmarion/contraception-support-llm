      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the birth control patch (and all methods containing estrogen - pills, ring, injection) are not safe for you because of your history of blood clots. Having had a DVT significantly increases your risk of developing another clot, and estrogen-containing contraceptives would increase that risk even more. Safe and effective alternatives include progestin-only pills, the contraceptive implant, the hormonal IUD (which has only local hormones), or the copper IUD. All of these are highly effective and won't increase your blood clot risk."

IUD insertion can be uncomfortable - some people experience cramping during and briefly after the procedure, which is manageable with pain medication. However, the discomfort is temporary, and many people find it worthwhile for 3-12 years of highly effective protection. As for infections, modern IUDs have a very low infection risk. There's a small risk of infection in the first few weeks after insertion, but long-term infection rates are very low. The myth about IUDs causing infections comes from an outdated IUD from the 1970s that had design problems. Today's IUDs are very safe. Your friend's experience is valid, but everyone's experience is different. Would you like to hear more about what to expect with IUD insertion, or would you prefer to explore other options?"

Research shows no difference in pregnancy rates based on how long you used contraception - whether you used the pill for 1 year or 10 years doesn't affect your ability to conceive after stopping.
